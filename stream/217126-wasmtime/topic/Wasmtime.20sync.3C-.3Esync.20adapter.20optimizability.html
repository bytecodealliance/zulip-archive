<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="254389">@Chris Fallin</span> <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="253990">@fitzgen (he/him)</span> question for y'all. Components historically have had a <code>may_{enter,leave}</code> flag associated with them which is a spec-level definition about reentrance protection and things like that. In the course of the component-model-async work this has changed, notably <code>may_enter</code>, which is no longer a flag but rather morally a stack that's passed around. In the course of component-model-async development work <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="509936">@Joel Dice</span> has run across a situation where the old <code>may_enter</code> handling is now broken and needs to be updated.</p>
<p>The easiest way to update things is to invoke a function that, on the host, that Joel already has for component-model-async work. This is basically already host host&lt;-&gt;guest calls work (or so I'm led to believe, Joel correct me if I'm wrong). The stickler here is guest&lt;-&gt;guest calls. Currently that manipulation/inspection of <code>may_{enter,leave}</code> is baked directly in the adapter between components. The flags are wasm globals defined in the <code>VMComponentInstance</code>.</p>
<p>This all brings me to the question for y'all: the easiest way to return to spec compliance is to update adapters to call a host function. I expect that this is unacceptable perf-wise for use caes y'all have envisioned for compile-time builtins. Are y'all in a position where you can't take a regression in compile-time-builtin runtime performance w.r.t. inlining and such? Or is there runway to land a host call for now and optimize later as necessary?</p>

<p>Hmm, thanks for the heads-up. Question: will this affect async-ABI components or "p2 style" (sync ABI) components as well?</p>
<p>It would be pretty unfortunate for our inlined "get a byte" accessor in a linked-in component to make a hostcall on every loop iteration in which it's called, to the extent that it would destroy our zero-copy story, so it would be nice if there were a path to not doing this. (FWIW I suspect once we have this zero-copy story working it'll be of interest to a lot of other embedded and network-stack folks as well.) Is there such a path or is it expected that this is the forever-solution?</p>

<p>Is there a reason that continuing to use globals is difficult? As Chris said, this would be pretty damning to the compile-time builtins story. Even the global is a lot more overhead than we want</p>

<p>This would affect all component&lt;-&gt;component interactions, including sync&lt;-&gt;sync functions, which is what wasip2 today exclusively uses.</p>
<p>To clarify, optimizations are possible here. It requires more compliation infrastructure, more analyses, more runtime data structures, etc. It is inevitable to me that this'll get implemented.</p>
<p>What I'm mostly curious on is whether these optimizations are a hard requirement today for anything to land</p>

</blockquote>
<p>It depends on how much up-front optimization we do.  If no optimization, then yes, sync ABI components will be affected.  One perhaps not-too-difficult optimization would be to detect that the component has only sync imports and exports at load time, carry that info through to the FACT module generator, and fall back to the existing check-and-set-a-flag behavior.  There are also other optimizations available.</p>

<p>I think if that single optimization were implemented (avoid all this if everything is sync) at least I would be happy for now (it would maintain our status-quo). We'd need to figure out how to avoid the hostcall when we eventually move to native async ABI but our embedding doesn't do that today.</p>
<p>It still seems like a pretty big perf regression in general for "tightly bound components" (little accessor calls) and I'm sure y'all have done a lot of thinking on this already but I'm happy to brainstorm or help on optimizations to make this logic inlined if needed!</p>

<p>I am not aware personally of anyone currently today relying on the absolute fastest possible performance between two components. I realize there are plans that could manifest in such a dependency, but I am under the impression that those plans are for the future.

<p>Yes, we don't literally have a dependence on this today either, but it's the sort of thing that needs to be resolved sooner than later from our PoV; the zero-copy approach we've sketched (and that Nick has built the foundations of) is pretty essential to us getting buy-in in the places where we plan to use Wasmtime. I guess I just want to make sure that we're not taking such a regression lightly.</p>
<p>I'm also curious -- we're not seeing the other side of the tradeoff here (or I haven't digested all the other threads that would give me that background, sorry) -- presumably this change is happening because of unforeseen corner cases? Or is it a spec change that has its own discussion and set of tradeoffs (such that we'd want to feed back this pain into that tradeoff decision)?</p>

<p>Yes, this is the result of a spec change related to async tasks.  Given that there can be more than one concurrent task for an instance at a given time, guarding against recursive reentrance requires not just asking "has this instance been entered" but "has this instance been entered for <em>this</em> task".  So rather than just a single flag that's global to the instance, we at minimum need a per-task bitset with capacity for the number of instances in a composition.  Please see the <code>CanonticalAbi.md</code> discussion of <code>trap_if_on_the_stack</code> for a list of optimization opportunities.</p>
<p>In short, we have some great options for optimizing this; it's just a question of how urgent those optimizations are vs. other priorities.</p>

<p>Even just the unoptimized version has proven a bit more complicated than I had initially expected, given that we need to check for recursive reentrance during initialization, when dropping resources, and during calls to <code>[Typed]Func::call</code> -- all places we previously relied on a per-instance flag and did not maintain a task stack.  The good news is that once we have the unoptimized version passing all tests, optimization should be straightforward, especially with a fresh mental model of everything.</p>

<p>A few of us have been discussing this on GitHub and elsewhere.  I'll try to summarize the latest thinking here, but note that there are still a lot of details to work out:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ultimate goal is to make sync-to-sync compositions as fast as practical, regardless of whether the callee uses async intrinsics or not.  We also want async-to-async, async-to-sync, and sync-to-async compositions to be as fast as practical, but the overheads for those cases tend to be shadowed by other performance constraints, so we have a bit more flexibility there.</li>
<li>Component model concurrency adds a few new pieces of state which need to be updated when crossing a component boundary:<br>
    - Which task-local storage to use<br>
    - The current thread ID<br>
    - The set of instances on the task's stack<br>
    - Whether or not the task may block</li>
<li>As much as practical, we'd like to avoid using host calls and minimize the amount of Cranelift code to run before and after invoking the callee.  We have a few ways we can do that:<br>
    - Statically analyze the component, which could be as simple as noticing whether it uses any concurrency features at all, or else involve more in-depth data flow analysis.  The idea here is that a component should only pay for what it uses.<br>
    - Avoid allocating a full <code>GuestTask</code> instance every time we enter a component instance and instead e.g. load and store state from/to stack slots allocated in Cranelift-generated adapter code.<br>
    - Possibly tweak the CM spec to e.g. allocate thread IDs from a separate index space from other handles, which would make them cheaper to create and destroy.  Luke also has ideas about how to restrict which lift/lower compositions are allowed by the spec, which could make data flow analysis and fine-grained, per-task instance stacks unnecessary.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/12153">My first effort</a> to apply a few of the above optimizations had mixed success, and the PR grew too big anyway.  I've since split out part of that into <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/12282">a more focused PR</a>.  I plan to follow that up with more PRs once we've determined the next steps.</p>

<p>More thinking on this -- <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/12311">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/12311</a></p>
<p>For reentrance Luke had an idea that means we can entirely eliminate all reentrance checks at runtime as it's a static property of a component as to whether reentrance is allowed. Given that the current state is:</p>
<ul>
<li>We'll remove <code>may_enter</code> due to the reentrancy idea.</li>
<li>(lazy lowering) will remove <code>may_leave</code>, a current part of sync&lt;-&gt;sync adapters</li>
<li>(wasip3) we'll eventually shift around where <code>may_block</code> will live (it'll be in <code>VMAsyncTask</code>)</li>
<li>(wasip3) we'll eventually shift to using <code>VMAsyncTask</code> so the manipulation will be a push/pop of a linked ilst </li>
<li>Eventually, with this push/pop, plus a few Cranelift optimizations I don't think will be too undue, we'll compile down to zero instructions on a sync&lt;-&gt;sync adapter</li>
</ul>
