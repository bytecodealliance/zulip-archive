<p>this isn't a minor issue. its production stop on production use for interactive work coz putting stuff like scripting in a plugin/dll is standard practice.</p>

<p>fixed it last time, will fix it this time too :)  it is disturbing. have to go deep on this stuff. also have other stuff I need to be getting on with but this is essential functionality so all my other work stops until this works again.</p>

<p>what do you think would happen if everyone started to post a zulip message every time they found out another detail about what they are currently working on?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we'd be more informed about the status of various stuff ?  </p>
<p>issue seems to be posts end up at the top of the board coz there's no threads here. </p>
<p>suggest you use matrix like mozilla do, then you'd only have to dive into my thread if it interested &amp; it wouldn't keep ending up at the top of the board.</p>
<p>zulip isn't that great. which probably offends, but matrix is better.</p>

<p>&amp; the reason for the post is end of day for me, if I get lucky, someone else as fixed it by the morning. probably not, but one can hope :) by explaining status, anyone else interested can pick it up if they want. this is basic teamwork.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="448652">@Steve Williams</span> you clearly are frustrated that something isn't working. That is however no excuse for the way you're engaging here. Chris and others have pointed out to you in the past how your way of engaging is outside acceptable norms in Bytecode Alliance spaces. I myself have reached out to you about related things in the past as well.</p>
<p>You're being confrontational and refusing to take in requests and suggestions meant to make your engagement more productive for all involved.</p>
<p>To be as clear as possible, and with my Technical Steering Committee member hat on: you have to stop these behaviors. You can NOT tell someone they're "getting annoying" and "stay out of my threads" as a reply to a polite request to change behaviors that are disruptive to others in this space. And whether you see them as such or not, your ways of engaging <em>are</em> disruptive: there is no such thing as "your threads, and messages in streams that people have subscribed to will notify them.</p>

<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="448652">@Steve Williams</span> I looked through the history of conversations involving both you and Chris, and disagree with your claim. But even if it were true, that wouldn't give you the right to be rude.</p>
<p>Additionally, your way of engaging not just with Chris but also others in this thread is not okay either. You don't like Zulip; that's okay. We'll not switch to something else as a result, though. If you want to engage in our spaces, you have to do it within the bounds we set, even if they're not the ones you want.</p>

<p>with the emotion out of this, is there a wasmtime c-api test that invokes a wasm from a dll on windows so the regression can be spotted next time it happens. suspect not &amp; that should be addressed. most important is to fix the thing first of course.</p>

<p>"this is not a forum for LLDB diffs; please take it to their issue tracker. Thanks."<br>
its the starting point for identifying why lldb breakpoints have regressed from DLLs.<br>
the disruption is because this affects production work. script developers cannot debug their code.<br>
the situation is disruptive, I just identified it.</p>

<p>that is not the disruption I'm talking about, and I think you know that. We all have to contend with bugs, sometimes ones that are hard blockers. That doesn't give any of us the right to engage outside of norms. Which, as people have told you a number of times, your way of sending long streams of messages is.</p>
<p>I will ask you once more to stop.</p>
