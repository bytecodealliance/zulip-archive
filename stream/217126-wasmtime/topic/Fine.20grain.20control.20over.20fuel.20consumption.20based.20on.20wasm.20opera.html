<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need to be able to specify different custom fuel costs for wasm operators.<br>
I see that there is already an issue for this <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11572">here</a> but it seems like there has been no progress on it since last year August.</p>
<p>I don't know if maybe for some reason it's been decided that perhaps it's not a good idea, or something that should be done, but if that's not the case, I'd like to take a try at it to open a PR.</p>
<p>Would like to hear any thoughts, maybe there's some bigger picture I'm missing out on here, or maybe this use-case is already possible through some other means.</p>

<p>My impression is that the work just hasn't been done yet, but the feature itself is still reasonable to add.</p>
