<p>Hey all I meant to give a heads up about this at the last Wasmtime meeting but I failed to account for the holiday on that day and so I didn't attend the meeting and broadcast this out. In lieu of that here I am! I'd like to share a "declaration of intent" of sorts of the beginning of the process of merging the wasip3-prototyping fork upstream into Wasmtime itself.</p>
<p>As background for those that aren't familiar the <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasip3-prototyping/">wasip3-prototyping repository</a> has been a staging ground for the implementation of component model async and WASIp3 primarily authored by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="509936">@Joel Dice</span> within Wasmtime and <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="484032">@Roman Volosatovs</span> for WASIp3 bits. This is a major feature being added to our component runtime and was developed out-of-tree to make development easier and avoid unnecessary churn in the main repo. The intention was to always merge upstream eventually and the time has now come for that.</p>
<p>The current thinking is to split the wasip3-prototyping into two major initiatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Wasmtime implementation of component model async foundations</li>
<li>WASIp3 APIs and implementations</li>
</ol>
<p>The initial pieces landing will exclusively be (1) meaning that <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> and <code>wasmtime-wasi-http</code> will have few, if any, changes made to them. The WASI bits are expected to come later once we're happy with the Wasmtime bits in-tree.</p>
<p>For the Wasmtime bits I've just talked with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="509936">@Joel Dice</span> and our thinking is that this is going to be split across four different PRs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Refactorings to our fiber abstraction in the Wasmtime crate. Component model async APIs do lots more with fibers than what Wasmtime currently does, so it's required to level up how we model fibers and interact with them. This refactoring is one of the "cruxes of unsafe" and will be its own PR to review in isolation.</li>
<li>Refactorings of everything surrounding component model async in Wasmtime without actually implementing component model async. The intention here will be that the "guts" of async bits are all stubbed out with <code>todo!()</code> but all other APIs in the <code>wasmtime</code> crate are updated to account for async (e.g. <code>Func::call_concurrent</code> will be added). This PR will showcase how the rest of <code>wasmtime</code> is affected with respect to concurrent/async APIs, but without actually introducing concurrency/async yet.</li>
<li>Next will be the actual implementation of concurrency/async in Wasmtime. This is mostly a file <code>concurrent.rs</code> and <code>futures_and_streams.rs</code>. This will be filling out <code>todo!()</code> blocks added in PR (2) above.</li>
<li>Tests will be added. This includes new <code>*.wast</code> tests, updates to <code>tests/all/*</code>, and a new major test suite at <code>crates/misc/component-async-tests/*</code>. </li>
</ol>
<p>The current intention is that no tests will land as part of PRs 1/2/3. Tests will only land in PR 4 above at the very end. The goal here is to reduce the size of the diff to make it more digestable and to reduce noise in the PR itself. The rationale for this is that the complete CI matrix is already passing in the wasip3-prototyping repo so we know that all tests are green across the board and that the implementation is already well-tested. Tests can always be consulted during review but they'll just temporarily only be available in an external repository until the final PR is reached.</p>
<hr>
<p>If anyone has questions/concerns on this plan please feel free to message here! This is the initial draft of an idea of how to upstream all this but both Joel and I are happy to adjust if others feel this should happen different. Currently there is no concrete plan for WASIp3 except "we know it's after the Wasmtime bits", and my hope is that we could use lessons learned from upstreaming the async bits as well.</p>

<p>the wasi-http spec has been in progress since 2022 and wasmtime-wasi-http has been in the wasmtime tree since april 2023. Its not super helpful or very welcome to get feedback that you're concerned about "bloat" if you arent familiar with the history of this interface and how its the foundation of the shipped component model implementations from several different vendors who fund wasmtime's development</p>

<p>Hey Oscar. Nothing was poor conduct on anyone's part. Simply a collision of ideas. <br>
I've reconsidered. I think wasi-http will be useful for us too, at least in the short term. Needs https support for real-world use cases, obviously. Swamped in work so don't know exactly what everyone else is doing. Hi :)</p>

<p>The big picture issue is on current trajectory, wasi will end up becoming an interface to o/s functionality. That's no bad thing but from a web perspective, such a thing is called a browser. We've delivered that to MVP already with current release wasmtime as our current wasm engine (thanks all).</p>

<p>If anything I'm doing falls outside of your interests or behaviour expectations, please be specific. Not trying to force technology onto anyone that's not wanted, nor to promote here when that's not wanted either.</p>
<p>The collision is wasm interfacing to the wider world - you're doing that one way, we're doing it another, html browsers do that a third way (via javascript bridge) &amp; there may well be other approaches.</p>
<p>None of this may interest &amp; you might wish to strictly adhere to your current development plan with no interest in alternatives &amp; if that's the case, that's cool &amp; can continue my work elsewhere with engagement here restricted to only where wasmtime specific issues arise.</p>

<p>It will, yes: <code>wasm32-wasip3</code>.  <code>wasi-libc</code> (and toolchains downstream from it) don't have support for that yet, so in the meantime you can target <code>wasm32-wasip2</code> and use <code>wit-bindgen</code>-generated bindings to access p3 features.
