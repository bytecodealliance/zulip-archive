<p>Are there cases where AoT consistently runs worse (in terms of execution time) than interpreted or fast-interpreted?F<br>
My Wasm binary basically allocates a struct on the heap, sets some values to random values using <code>rand()</code>, and returns the memory address of the struct. </p>
<p>The struct gets freed later on the host side. I see consistent peaks that tank performance at around every 10 invocations at a frequency of 500Hz. </p>
<p>The boxplot looks wild compared to the interpreted version, with even the means being the same, and the 25% quantiles are also larger than interpreted.</p>
<p>I was wondering if the memory allocation is the issue. It's probably hard to tell in general, but maybe someone has similar experiences. Thanks!</p>

<p>That's interesting. Would you mind sharing more details for reproduction?</p>
