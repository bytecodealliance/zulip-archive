<p>Hi, <br>
I'm trying to use WAMR on top of some rust OS using the <code>wamr-rust-sdk</code> crate. This is only for testing/benchmarking pupose so I'm not worried about doing a proper port. <br>
Anyway, after tinkering around I was able to compile to run on an NRF52840DK (Thumbv7 arch) and I have had errors regarding allocations. After tracking the source of my error, I realized that this is because I stubbed <code>os_mmap</code> from the <code>platform_api_vmcore.h</code>. I'm  surprised by this being an issue for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>This function is in a section called <code>APIs required by WAMR AOT</code> and compiled without AOT support and in the configuration specified that I wanted to run the interpreter. </li>
<li>I used the memory pool allocation strategy instead of using the system alloc strategy. </li>
</ul>
<p>This leads me to the following questions :</p>
<ul>
<li>Did I misunderstand something ? </li>
<li>What does the memory pool strategy do if not use the provided pool to put the linear memory of the instances ? </li>
<li>It seems to require more memory that I would have thought: loading the modules fails when the pool is under 120 KiB, despite the module weighing 262 bytes by itself and the linear memory seemingly not being part of the equation.</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact allocation path is related to the linear memory of the instance i'm trying to build. I'm using WAMR 2.3.1, the version used by the <code>wamr-rust-sdk</code></p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>I'm not quite following the sentence of "because I stubbed os_mmap from the platform_api_vmcore.h." However, I assume it suggests that the problem is caused by an incorrect implementation of <code>os_mmap()</code>.</p>
<p>The statement "APIs required by WAMR AOT" is outdated, that's for sure. It should be updated to reflect the fact that wasm_memory.c is used to create linear memory across all three allocation strategies.</p>
<p>Besides the part for the WASM file itself, the runtime also requires memory resources for its own operation and execution, which can be configured by arguments of <code>wasm_runtime_instantiate()</code> such as <code>default_stack_size</code> and <code>host_managed_heap_size</code> . Additionally, the initial and maximum linear memory size, like <code>(memory 10 20)</code>, of the WASM module can be partially controlled by compilation flags.</p>

<p>Not quite an incorrect implementation, I just hadn't implemented it. </p>

<p>Ok, that's what I figured but it's nice to be reassured that I'm not crazy. </p>

</blockquote>
<p>Makes sense, however in the specific context I didn't have much control on <code>wasm_runtime_instantiate</code> arguments so maybe 120KiB is a default somewhere ? </p>
<p>That being said, I still don't get what <code>Alloc_With_Pool</code> does if <code>os_mmap</code> is still used in the process of allocating the linear memory. Maybe it's another case of outdated information but this <a href="https://bytecodealliance.github.io/wamr.dev/blog/the-wamr-memory-model/#memory-allocators">blog post</a> flat out says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mode restricts all the memory used by wamr in a fixed memory region that was provided by the host during initiating the WAMR runtime. All the memory categories are allocated inside the memory region by using WAMR built-in memory allocator <code>ems</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which to me means that <code>os_mmap</code> shouldn't have to be implemented. Or is supposed to be implemented by redirecting calls to this <code>ems</code> allocator ?</p>

<p>Thanks for the pointer. I have already basically copied the implementation from RIOT and now the interpreter works. I still have some issues with AOT however. Still I'm not sure that I grasp the various memory models of WAMR if I end up using the system allocator whether I want to or not... </p>
<p>For the WAMR AOT stuff, in some files, wamr fails with <code>AOT module load failed: resolve symbol __aeabi_memclr failed</code>. <br>
The target is an Rasperry PI Pico 2 W. Wamr is compiled with  <code>WAMR_BUILD_TARGET = "THUMBV8M.MAIN"</code> and the AOT file was produced with <code>wamrc --target=thumbv8m.main --target-abi=eabihf</code> <br>
Any idea of where that could come from ? </p>
<p>Thanks for the previous replies btw !</p>

<p>You might want to add platform specification implementation under core/iwasm/aot/arch.</p>
