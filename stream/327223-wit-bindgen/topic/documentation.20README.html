<p>The README seems heavily outdated.</p>
<p>It says at the beginning, that the repo developes C#, C, Java, TinyGo and Rust.</p>
<p>Thats not correct at multiple levels, given that Java is not supported anymore, C++ is supported as well, and I think the community implementations of Javascript and Python deserve to be mentioned as well.</p>
<p>Plus, there seems to be some support for Moonbit, and half of all that information is contained somewhere later down the README, and not at the top.</p>
<p>I send a PR regarding the order of some of that initial paragraph, but it seems I need to check out first, whats the real support status on all languages.</p>

<p>Hey <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="926999">@ShalokShalom</span> thanks for taking on the work to improve the README for <code>wit-bindgen</code> -- I think what you posted here would have gone really well in a Github issue (that you could close with the PR you're about to create).</p>
<p>Looking forward to your proposed update!</p>

<p>Thanks. I am questioning, if my recollection of the new stuff is complete?</p>

<p>I think it's certainly a good start -- others will be able to chime in on the PR and help shape up your updates!</p>
<p>At this point, the best "source of truth" is the code (as you've found!) and having an update to get the README more in line with what is implemented would be a great contribution</p>
