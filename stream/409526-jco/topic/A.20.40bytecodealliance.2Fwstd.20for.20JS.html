<p>I've been wanting a library under the jco project wherein we can put tooling (essentially an SDK) that would make the developer experience of JS components more convenient. After a bit of discussion in the JS subgroup meeting yesterday since there were no large objections, I'd like to discuss it here as well.</p>
<p>An example use case for this is enabling an <code>express</code>-like facade for users that want to build <code>wasi:http/incoming-handler</code> based servers:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="JavaScript"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">import</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">express</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kr">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'@bytecodealliance/wstd/http/servers'</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="kd">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">app</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">express</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">get</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"/hello/:name"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">=&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="nx">res</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sb">`hello </span><span class="si">${</span><span class="nx">req</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">params</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="sb">`</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">})</span>

<span class="nx">app</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">listen</span><span class="p">();</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The above code should produce a component that exports <code>wasi:http-incoming-handler</code>, and be fairly easy to modify and most importantly <strong>be familiar to server-side JS devs today</strong>. </p>
<p>The idea is that <em>before</em> <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/issues/188">Node builtins land in StarlingMonkey (or anywhere below jco)</a>, we want to give users a good experience while they build JS components.</p>
<p>Ideally, this project completely goes away when all of NodeJS and it's ecosystem works smoothly in WebAssembly, but as we've seen with other runtimes (Bun, Deno, etc) -- that can take quite a while, and corner-cases abound.</p>
<p><strong>Any feedback on this before I make the proposal would be welcome.</strong> </p>
<p>One thing I'm struggling with (assuming this is a good idea) whether to call it <code>wstd</code> (following in the footsteps of the similarly named Rust crate by <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="344849">@Yosh Wuyts</span> ), or <code>jco-sdk</code> (since it may not necessarily be only standard library functions), or even <code>jco-std</code>.</p>

<p>Are you already familiar with the hono examples shared last JS working group meeting? We already have access to a production quality web framework with sophisticated middleware.</p>
<p>I also went in depth at the wasmCloud community meeting:<br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/wSG_ypHAiiM?t=136">https://www.youtube.com/live/wSG_ypHAiiM?t=136</a></p>
<p>It works really well and workflows like oauth, oidc, SSR JSX components, etc are all there.</p>
<p>What I'd really like in something like std is a filesystem api readily available. Would be great to align on node:fs for wide familiarity but deno's FS api is really well aligned on platform features like leveraging WHATWG streams while less familiar is easy to pick up.</p>

<p>You Betcha! I work with <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="712279">@Lachlan Heywood</span>  :)</p>
<p>The problem is that most developers actually don't know Hono -- they're familiar with Express:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>express</code> has 166M downloads a week</li>
<li><code>hono</code> has 3M</li>
<li><code>fastify</code> has 10M</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not even close, for better or for worse. And what makes <code>hono</code> work (it's been built wonderfully) is it's closeness to standards and <em>built in flexibility</em> -- the reason it was able to be adapted so well is because of how Hono was built, and unfortunately other older frameworksa ren't quite that way.</p>
<p>I'm interested in meeting developers where they are <em>today</em>, and making a good experience for them and I think a facade for Express would do that -- hopefully I'm not mistaken here.</p>
<p>Also, just a side note, it's absolutely intended that we have the <code>hono</code> implementation (and others!) available as part of this new SDK!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I may be biased, but I also think this is a good fit for this model :)</p>
<p>Having a <code>fs</code> module (maybe next to <code>http</code>) that looks a lot like <code>fs/promises</code> from Node (with a little <code>fs-extra</code> thrown in!) but is not bound to strict Node compat would be great for developers.</p>

<p>We of course want to be standards forward, but adoption is usually quite tied with <em>familiarity</em> -- Hono is a great example of doing both -- their API looks like Fastify but is incredibly flexible due to their adoption of standards.</p>
<p>We want something similar :)</p>
<p>Also, another example that people are going to want to do is be able to access functionality like <code>random</code>/<code>crypto</code> that they would normally just import. Right now there are two ways they can do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add &amp; use <code>wasi:random/random</code> themselves</li>
<li>Bundle a pure-JS implementation of <code>sha256</code>/simple hashing functions</li>
</ul>
<p>(I didn't pull that usecase out of thin air, one of our customers actually asked for this/tried to do this almost immediately after starting w/ the jco ecosystem)</p>
<p>One cool thing that we might be forced to deal with in this case is a system for noting the dependencies of various projects in NodeJS packages -- if you <code>import</code> a random helper, it would be great if in the <code>package.json</code> we could either find the <code>wit</code> file (if it was included in the package), or just <em>know</em> that <code>wasi:cli/random</code> is used (so we can update the resulting component accordingly.</p>

<p>I see the argument, but my concern is that what makes express valuable is the ecosystem and plugins. I think folks can handle the hello world / simple router example difference to hono and I'm skeptical of how a look alike express will be taken if the ecosystem around it is incompatible. I feel like that was a big lesson learned from the Deno folks and them / bun have done massive efforts for deep node compatibility to capture that mindshare. Getting express to work is nice but getting, i.e. next.js working is useful and a huge leap.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I agree here, but I think the problem is fractal in that way -- the ecosystem and plugins will be in a some-supported-some-not until we get Node builtins at the StarlingMonkey level (and likely even after, because that obviously doesn't solve natively built packages).</p>
<p>I think the question is, is an express-like DX possible <em>before</em> then, or not.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I see the question here -- my reasoning is pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>If Hono compat is good, Express compat is even better</li>
<li>Hono suffers from the same ecosystem, as soon as people try to use libraries that depend on platform functionality (i.e. those that are a bit further from Hono's principles, or just anything in the NodeJS ecosystem). We don't have an official platform name w/ Hono (yet?), so there's no way for libraries to build <em>for</em> WASI.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I feel like that was a big lesson learned from the Deno folks and them / bun have done massive efforts for deep node compatibility to capture that mindshare. Getting express to work is nice but getting, i.e. next.js working is useful and a huge leap.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree, but it took them <em>literally years</em> to get there, and they're not all the way there yet :)</p>
<p>The work at the StarlingMonkey level is certainly crucial (NodeJS support at that level), but there's probably a bunch of time between now and then. </p>
<p>The goal is for large swaths of this new library to be obsoleted by StarlingMonkey level NodeJS support (and eventually, someday, maybe, fully upstreamed NodeJS WASI support), but until then, just like the Hono adapter delivers value, it would be great to give other (sometimes larger) parts of the ecosystem the same treatment.</p>

<p>Thanks for the pointer -- I did mean the Crypto API! I stand corrected, the min common api spec certainly has that use case covered, I guess the gap then is just documentation, and eventual Node API support so code "just works" when it's imported.</p>
<p>That's not a great example, but a better one is <code>fs</code> which was already mentioned, bearing some similarity to the node-like APIs that people generally reach for today.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned the most compelling examples are widely used libraries like <code>express</code> or <code>fs-extra</code>,  -- things that don't "just work" yet, but are critical for building a non-trivial app. These are the first things someone will have imported, and until we have Node API support at the StarlingMonkey level (the ultimate solution here), people will have a hard time adopting the Wasm JS ecosystem.</p>

<p>very quickly on the <code>jco-transpile</code> project: I'm still not really convinced that it makes sense to split this out into its own repository. In my mind, that would only make sense if both of these conditions held:</p>
<ol>
<li>there is a fundamentally separate set of maintainers with no real overlap</li>
<li>there are no dependencies between the two</li>
</ol>
<p>I don't think either of these holds, and in particular worry about the second one. To give a completely different example, we moved Cranelift into the Wasmtime repository years ago because we realized that we'd either have to do that, or over time would end up writing a second embedding replicating much of Wasmtime, simply because to fully and properly test Cranelift we'd need a pretty comprehensive testing embedding. And then the question is, why isn't that just Wasmtime. And since you really don't want circular (developer workflow) dependencies across multiple repositories, merging them became obvious.</p>

<p>What I'd instead strongly favor is restructuring the jco repository to contain both of these as separate, independently usable packages, but still being able to lean on jco for fully exercising the transpile API surface</p>

<p>In this case, the request is actually driven by user demand -- I think we risk fragmenting the ecosystem by not allowing users (folks at Arcjet in this case) to use jco's transpilation stuff <em>only</em>. </p>
<p>To be clear this is to <em>add</em> a <code>jco-transpile</code> project, which can be used from <code>jco</code> -- so I think we're agreed actually? Right now we don't have independently usable packages, we have just <code>jco</code> but it pulls in stuff not needed in particular by transpile.</p>
