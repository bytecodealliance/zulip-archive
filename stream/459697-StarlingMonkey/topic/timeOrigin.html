<p><span class="user-mention" data-user-id="763150">@Tomasz Andrzejak</span> what I said about using Unix timestamp 0 as the timeOrigin in StarlingMonkey unfortunately was wrong <span aria-label="frown" class="emoji emoji-1f641" role="img" title="frown">:frown:</span> What I didn't account for is that this could result in violations of monotonicity, for example if the system clock is changed.</p>
<p>I think we do need to employ the kind of scheme I briefly sketched out: during wizer resumption, check if a timeOrigin was set during wizening. If so, take a "second origin", and subtract the delta between that and the first one from all values. The result should I think be that it seems like no time passed between wizening and resumption, and we retain monotonicity.</p>
