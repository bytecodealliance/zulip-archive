<p>Hi all.  Is there still value in the monthly SIG-Guest-Languages meeting?  Victor and I were the only ones who showed up today, and we didn't have anything to discuss.</p>
<p>Early on, they had value as a way to share status updates, plans, and tooling ideas across guest language efforts, but since then we've been doing a pretty good job coordinating outside of the meetings (e.g. in this channel, on GitHub, etc.), so I'm not sure if the synchronous meetings are adding value.  Maybe we leave it on the calendar, but only actually meet if there are agenda items?</p>
