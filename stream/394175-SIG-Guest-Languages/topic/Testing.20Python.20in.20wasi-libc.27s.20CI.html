<p>In <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc/pull/667">https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-libc/pull/667</a>  I'm adding a new job to wasi-libc's CI which builds Python with the in-tree copy of libc. The intent is to help increase the test coverage for wasi-libc, but I also know very little of Python and how its build system/etc are all set up. If someone with a more Python-trained eye would like to give thoughts/opinions it'd be most welcome!</p>

<p>Ok <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="595471">@Brett Cannon</span> a few questions for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is updating to wasi-sdk-28 in Python's CI as simple as a PR? If I were to do that I think it's all checked in CI, right? Is there any other sort of process that I should be aware of? For example if I were to subsequently release wasi-sdk-29 which will likely happen soon, is there enough process that I should avoid doing this or is it lightweight enough that one PR to upgrade to 28, then a subsequent one later for 29, would be ok? To give you a sense of scale <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/cpython/commit/763b4c213646b63de7afabf3b9804d0bfcc17ef0">these are the changes necessary</a> to get tests working. I'd more thoroughly investigate the max-stack-size thing before proposing another doubling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Have you and/or Python folks thought much about WASIp2 support? Joel and I have been running Python tests with WASIp2 by "hacking around it" and passing <code>CFLAGS="--target wasm32-wasip2"</code>. As far as we can tell this is really all that's needed as everything Python needs goes exclusively through wasi-libc so it's just a matter of compiler flags (e.g. wasi-sdk stays the same). The artifact of the final <code>*.wasm</code> changes, however, from a core module to a component. Is this something that Python would be interested in, perhaps even just as a test in CI before it's official? Or something that's best left for a debate for another day?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WASIp2 is a leading question. I'd like to, in wasi-libc's CI, run the test suite of Python with sockets support. This requires the <code>wasm32-wasip2</code> target as sockets don't work in <code>wasm32-wasip1</code>. That's fine and all, but the changes in Python to make the test suite pass <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/cpython/commit/e5fc8ee96e230b62419ce4abeaa7f5b64328111f">are fairly large</a>. I had to annotate a whole bunch of tests with "this needs threads to run" and on the tail end of some tests I had to add some checks for <code>sys.platform == 'wasi'</code> which didn't  feel great. This is a large enough patch that I wouldn't want to carry this in wasi-libc and would prefer to effectively upstream directly, but I'm not sure how amenable upstream would be to this. My read of other tests is that sprinkling <code>@threading_helper.requires_working_threading()</code> around is probably fine, but checking for <code>sys.platform</code> is probably not fine. As I imagine you already sprinkled a bunch of annotations around though I'm curious to get your take on this as well and if you have thoughts</p>

<p>It can't go in without it being official, and that's not going to happen until WASI 0.3.1 and I get threads as I'm not comfortable claiming socket support without <code>test_socket</code> passing (same thing I brought up at the Plumber's summit at MS a couple of years ago when we met in person).</p>

<p>Both are fine (as long as you use the right helper in . Welcome to trying to support a wide range of OSs in a large, wide-ranging code base that tickles every OSs quirks! <span aria-label="wink" class="emoji emoji-1f609" role="img" title="wink">:wink:</span></p>
<p>So I'm good with accepting a PR to add the appropriate annotations so you can test p2 in wasi-libc as long as I don't have to worry about p2 support in WASI until I can run <code>test_socket</code> appropriately.</p>

<p>Nice, that all sounds pretty good. I'll try to make a PR for wasi-sdk-29 in the coming days.</p>
<p>For p2/annotations, I'm hesitant to land all these annotations in upstream python if nothing is testing them since they seem like it'd easily regress. I've got <code>test_socket</code> running locally insofar as everything requiring threads is auto-skipped, but are you saying that <code>test_socket</code> needs to pass fully, including threads, to support adding a new CI target?</p>

<p>Yes because my worry is so much is skipped without threads that I don't feel comfortable saying sockets are supported otherwise.</p>

<p>I just wanted to give a quick thanks to <span class="user-mention" data-user-id="253994">@Alex Crichton</span> for getting CPython on to WASI SDK 29 and bearing with me as we tested out the latest flow for a version bump!</p>
