<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>Pulley should support <code>weval</code> such that, on wasm platforms, it can be aot compiled if modules are known statically.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>This would unlock aot compilation of components down to core wasm using Wasmtime, along with enhancing <code>weval</code> to be able to process programs like itself.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<ul>
<li>If WASM is not supported currently in Pulley, that would have to be implemented first</li>
<li>A Rust api for <code>weval</code>'s WASM interface would also be needed</li>
<li>After that, it should really just come down to calling the functions when needed</li>
</ul>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>For components, another route is converting them fully to js with <code>jco</code>, then using something like Porffor to aot compile it.  The rest could be done by allowing <code>wizer</code> to use the js engine WASM runtime, which would be provided by StarlingMonkey, which can further aot compile to a component, coverable with the previous alternative. These pipelines, while somewhat easier to plan for, are convoluted for the user and might massively reduce performance.</p>

<p>This idea is roughly plausible, but the prerequisite (which you note) of Wasmtime-with-Pulley-on-Wasm is the major dependency here that pushes it to a "long-term idea" bucket, IMHO. I'll note that "enhancing weval to be able to process programs like itself." is a research question bordering on intractability (the interpreter that weval processes really does need to be in the right shape; this is getting at the second and third Futamura projections which I don't yet know how to do in an imperative-IR world). And "just" in "it should really just come down to" is doing a lot of heavy lifting as well: getting the Pulley interpreter into a form that could partial-evaluate back out to Wasm-sandboxed-inside-Wasm is a significant and uncertain project.</p>
<p>I suspect there might be an X-Y problem at play here: what is the end goal you're driving toward? If "AOT compilation of components down to core Wasm", I suspect there are simpler and more direct designs that would do that (abstracting out Wasmtime's adapter generation into a tool that does module linking). If "application embedding Wasmtime to run a Wasm module, all compiled together into a Wasm", some sort of linking approach that hoists the Wasm module to a native Wasm module alongside the rest of the application is likely to be a much shorter path to a performant and tractable design. Happy to offer further thoughts if it's something different than that, of course.</p>

<p>I was, in fact, getting at those other futamura projections. However, as you pointed out, weval might not be ready for that sort of process yet. That could probably be split out into a more long-term project (requiring inlining in both our waffles, among other optimizations).</p>

<p>The goal is primarily AOT compilation of components to core WASM; Wasmtime is the only WASM runtime with native component model support, and tools like jco and wasm-component-layer use its API. This distances the component model from a standard, and  incurs seperate projects like <code>pit</code> and alternate, witx-using, WASI forks like WASIX to support more runtimes. Compiling components to core WASM would allow interaction with those core-wasm-using systems, in addition to allow running on underpowered systems where a further compiler is required.</p>
<p>Embedding Wasmtime, and further on, <code>weval</code> support, may solve this, but seems to be too much work, and I understand that. However, our ABIs can be bridged; a wip version of one can be found as the <code>pit</code> WIT bridge (note that it uses my fork of waffle). We could split that goal of compiling components to core WASM into another issue (possibly somewhere else?). Feel free to close and reopen when ready.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For sure, I actually fully agree that there should be a better tooling path toward lowering components into core Wasm that is portable -- I'm not the best person to speak to plans or thoughts on that, but maybe @alexcrichton or @pchickey are. My main point is only that I think partially evaluating a Wasm interpreter over a Wasm module is quite an indirect and brittle path to get a module inside a component to pop out the other side; and moreover from a planning point of view I don't want to put "make weval good enough to make that pipeline invisible" on the critical path of such a useful tool idea.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Personally yeah I would agree with @cfallin that there are likely better routes than weval to bringing component runtimes elsewhere. I believe wasmedge was working on a component model implementation in addition to one or two other engines, but I'm not sure of the progress at this time.</p>
