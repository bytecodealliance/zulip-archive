<p>cfallin opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11826">PR #11826</a> from <code>cfallin:wasmtime-debug-traps</code> to <code>bytecodealliance:main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Stacked on top of #11769.)</p>
<p>As part of the new guest-debugging API, we want to allow the host to<br>
execute the debugged guest code asynchronously, receiving its "debug<br>
step" results each time a debugging-relevant event occurs. In the<br>
fullness of time, this will include: traps, thrown exceptions,<br>
breakpoints and watchpoints hit, single-steps, etc.</p>
<p>As a first step, this PR adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A notion of running an asynchronous function call in a "debug<br>
  session";</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An API on that debug session object (which owns the store while the<br>
  function is running) that provides an async method to get the next<br>
<code>DebugStepResult</code>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An implementation that transmutes traps into a debug-step result,<br>
  allowing introspection of the guest state before the trap tears down<br>
  its stack;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to the stack introspection API provided by <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11769">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11769</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation works by performing <em>call injection</em> from the signal<br>
handler. The basic idea is that rather than perform an exception resume<br>
from the signal handler, directly rewriting register state to unwind all<br>
Wasm frames and return the error code to the host, we rewrite register<br>
state to redirect to a handwritten assembly stub. This stub cannot<br>
assume anything about register state (because we don't enforce any<br>
constraints on register state at all the points that trapping signals<br>
could occur); thus, it has to save every register. To allow this<br>
trampoline to do anything at all, we inject a few parameters to it; the<br>
original values of the parameter registers, as well as the original PC<br>
(location of the trap), are saved to the store so they can be restored<br>
into the register-save frame before the injected stub returns (if it<br>
does).</p>
<p>The injected stub can then call into the runtime to perform a<br>
fiber-suspend, setting a "debug yield" value that indicates that a trap<br>
occurred.</p>
<p>A few notes on design constraints that forced my hand in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We need to inject a call by rewriting only register state, not pushing<br>
  a new frame from within the stack handler, because it appears that<br>
  Windows vectored exception handlers run on the same stack as the guest<br>
  and so there is no room to push an additional frame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need access to the store from the signal context now; we can get<br>
  this from TLS if we add a raw backpointer from VMStoreContext to<br>
  StoreOpaque. I <em>believe</em> we aren't committing any serious pointer<br>
  provenance or aliasing-rules crimes here, because dynamically we are<br>
  taking ownership of the store back when we're running within the<br>
  signal context (it's as if it was passed as an argument, via a very<br>
  circuitous route), but I could very well be wrong. I hope we can find<br>
  another working approach if so!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trap suspend protocol looks a little like a resumable trap but<br>
  only because we need to properly tear down the future (otherwise we<br>
  get a panic on drop). Basically we resume back, and if the trap was a<br>
  non-resumable trap, the assembly stub returns not to the original PC<br>
  but the PC of <em>another</em> stub that does the original<br>
  resume-to-entry-handler action.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is set up here for resumable traps (e.g. for breakpoints) to<br>
also work, but I haven't implemented that yet; that's the next PR (and<br>
requires some other machinery, most notably a private copy of code<br>
memory and the ability to edit and re-publish it; and metadata to<br>
indicate where to patch in breaks; and a <code>pc += BREAK_SIZE</code> somewhere to<br>
skip over on resume).</p>
<p>This is a draft that works on Linux on x86-64; I still need to implement</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] aarch64, riscv64, s390x assembly stubs</li>
<li>[ ] Windows and macOS updates to trap handlers</li>
<li>[ ] equivalent behavior on the <code>raise</code> libcall too, not just<br>
      signal-based traps</li>
</ul>
<p>but I wanted to post it now to communicate the current direction and get<br>
any early feedback.</p>

<h4>Label Messager: wasmtime:config</h4>
<p>It looks like you are changing Wasmtime's configuration options. Make sure to<br>
complete this check list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[ ] If you added a new <code>Config</code> method, you wrote extensive documentation for<br>
      it.</p>
<p>&lt;details&gt;</p>
<p>Our documentation should be of the following form:</p>
<p>```text<br>
Short, simple summary sentence.</p>
<p>More details. These details can be multiple paragraphs. There should be<br>
information about not just the method, but its parameters and results as<br>
well.</p>
<p>Is this method fallible? If so, when can it return an error?</p>
<p>Can this method panic? If so, when does it panic?</p>
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>Optional example here.<br>
```</p>
<p>&lt;/details&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ ] If you added a new <code>Config</code> method, or modified an existing one, you<br>
  ensured that this configuration is exercised by the fuzz targets.</p>
<p>&lt;details&gt;</p>
<p>For example, if you expose a new strategy for allocating the next instance<br>
slot inside the pooling allocator, you should ensure that at least one of our<br>
fuzz targets exercises that new strategy.</p>
<p>Often, all that is required of you is to ensure that there is a knob for this<br>
configuration option in [<code>wasmtime_fuzzing::Config</code>][fuzzing-config] (or one<br>
of its nested <code>struct</code>s).</p>
<p>Rarely, this may require authoring a new fuzz target to specifically test this<br>
configuration. See [our docs on fuzzing][fuzzing-docs] for more details.</p>
<p>&lt;/details&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ ] If you are enabling a configuration option by default, make sure that it<br>
  has been fuzzed for at least two weeks before turning it on by default.</p>
</li>

step" results each time a debugging-relevant event occurs. In the<br>
fullness of time, this will include: traps, thrown exceptions,<br>
breakpoints and watchpoints hit, single-steps, etc.</p>
<p>As a first step, this PR adds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A notion of running an asynchronous function call in a "debug<br>
  session";</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An API on that debug session object (which owns the store while the<br>
  function is running) that provides an async method to get the next<br>
<code>DebugStepResult</code>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An implementation that transmutes traps into a debug-step result,<br>
  allowing introspection of the guest state before the trap tears down<br>
  its stack;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Access to the stack introspection API provided by <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11769">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11769</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The implementation works by performing <em>call injection</em> from the signal<br>
handler. The basic idea is that rather than perform an exception resume<br>
from the signal handler, directly rewriting register state to unwind all<br>
Wasm frames and return the error code to the host, we rewrite register<br>
state to redirect to a handwritten assembly stub. This stub cannot<br>
assume anything about register state (because we don't enforce any<br>
constraints on register state at all the points that trapping signals<br>
could occur); thus, it has to save every register. To allow this<br>
trampoline to do anything at all, we inject a few parameters to it; the<br>
original values of the parameter registers, as well as the original PC<br>
(location of the trap), are saved to the store so they can be restored<br>
into the register-save frame before the injected stub returns (if it<br>
does).</p>
<p>The injected stub can then call into the runtime to perform a<br>
fiber-suspend, setting a "debug yield" value that indicates that a trap<br>
occurred.</p>
<p>A few notes on design constraints that forced my hand in several ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We need to inject a call by rewriting only register state, not pushing<br>
  a new frame from within the stack handler, because it appears that<br>
  Windows vectored exception handlers run on the same stack as the guest<br>
  and so there is no room to push an additional frame.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We need access to the store from the signal context now; we can get<br>
  this from TLS if we add a raw backpointer from VMStoreContext to<br>
  StoreOpaque. I <em>believe</em> we aren't committing any serious pointer<br>
  provenance or aliasing-rules crimes here, because dynamically we are<br>
  taking ownership of the store back when we're running within the<br>
  signal context (it's as if it was passed as an argument, via a very<br>
  circuitous route), but I could very well be wrong. I hope we can find<br>
  another working approach if so!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The trap suspend protocol looks a little like a resumable trap but<br>
  only because we need to properly tear down the future (otherwise we<br>
  get a panic on drop). Basically we resume back, and if the trap was a<br>
  non-resumable trap, the assembly stub returns not to the original PC<br>
  but the PC of <em>another</em> stub that does the original<br>
  resume-to-entry-handler action.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything is set up here for resumable traps (e.g. for breakpoints) to<br>
also work, but I haven't implemented that yet; that's the next PR (and<br>
requires some other machinery, most notably a private copy of code<br>
memory and the ability to edit and re-publish it; and metadata to<br>
indicate where to patch in breaks; and a <code>pc += BREAK_SIZE</code> somewhere to<br>
skip over on resume).</p>
<p>This is a draft that works on Linux on x86-64; I still need to implement</p>
<ul>
<li>[x] aarch64, riscv64, s390x assembly stubs</li>
<li>[ ] Windows and macOS updates to trap handlers</li>
<li>[x] equivalent behavior on the <code>raise</code> libcall too, not just<br>
      signal-based traps</li>
</ul>
<p>but I wanted to post it now to communicate the current direction and get<br>
any early feedback.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>integrating with the separate exception-handling thread on macOS is proving to be a little unexpectedly interesting</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One idea to work with this is that, for all platforms, when the signal handler updates state to the trampoline to call out to the host anything clobbered is pushed to the stack instead of saved in the store.  For example the stack pointer would be decremented by 32, the first 16 bytes being the saved return address/frame pointer (pretending it's a called frame) and the next 16 bytes would be 2 clobbered registers or something like that. That would work on macOS and all other platforms as well and means that the store isn't necessary in the signal handler routine at least.</p>
<p>Also, somewhat orthogonal, but I don't think that the asm stubs need to save all registers, only the caller-saved ones according to the native ABI, right? </p>

<p>I'm not sure of a way other than what you've described you've done in this PR already with a <code>call_debug</code>. The <code>call</code>/<code>call_async</code> interfaces effectively fundamentally don't do what you want which is that they take and "lock" the store for the entire duration of the call. There's no way to interrupt the call halfway through and get the store back at the caller side. This works for host imports because once within the future we can temporarily loan the store to the host during a host call, but that doesn't work for giving the store back to the original caller. I do agree though that <code>call_debug</code> is not great and doesn't compose well with generated bindings, so I agree it'd be worthwhile to try to fix this.</p>
<p>What might work best is to go ahead and sketch out <code>call_debug</code> and test/implement with that for now and we can brainstorm later about a possible alternative. My suspicion is that it's going to look like <code>run_concurrent</code> from the component-model-async proposal.</p>

<p>and also restated over in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11835#issuecomment-3398091021">this</a> comment; a <em>hostcall</em> is effectively an interrupt to a call, and so if one sees any debug-step yield that occurs at a trapping instruction as a fancy way of that instruction "calling" back to the host, I think this should actually work. Very important is the way that the lifetimes are tied together on the <code>async fn next</code> on the session: it takes a <code>Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;</code> with the implicit lifetime there tied to the future, so it <em>does</em> own the store until the future is ready; but the future becomes ready (async fn returns) every time a "debug step result" / debug event occurs, which is effectively such a hostcall. Does that make sense? I think this capability is pretty important for the feasibility of the whole enterprise here so I'm happy to try to explain it another way if needed :-)</p>

<p>This API makes sense to me, modulo bike shedding the exact naming and such.</p>
<p>We could alternatively, if we wanted to rearrange some deck chairs, make the API a callback on the <code>Store</code> that is given the debugging-equivalent of <code>Caller</code> and a step/break/etc event, instead of designing the API as a coroutine that returns many step/break/etc events until the computation completes. This is essentially what SpiderMonkey's <code>Debugger</code> API exposes: when you set a breakpoint, for example, you provide a callback that is invoked with the <code>Debugger.Frame</code> object when the breakpoint is hit (for us it would be that and the <code>Caller</code>) and you return a "continuation value" which is morally <code>enum { Return(Value), Throw(Value), Panic }</code>. This is potentially easier to integrate transparently with existing API usage (e.g. an existing call into host <code>bindgen!</code> code).</p>
<p>But these two approaches are basically the same at the end of the day, and we should be able to make either work if we can make one of them work.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>(In the current implementation, nested debug sessions are forbidden dynamically, and the debug session sees only one Wasm activation deep i.e. from Wasm entry to Wasm exit and any hostcall is an atomic step; these simplifying restrictions are important to the coherency of the above too, IMHO.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Callbacks, rather than coroutines, should also Just Work for multiple activations, I think.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>That's fair, yeah; the thing I am trying to aim for is a nice API for the debugger main event loop, and a callback-based approach would have to timeslice debugger and debuggee at the top level and use a channel to push events from the callback, then pause if waiting for a "continue" token; this is also more awkward in a world that we have the debugger component using all this from behind a wit interface. Whereas the async coroutine approach unfolds this in a way that can work in a single thread without channels; the program-under-test is "just" a thing that one can poll for the next output. But, either could work.</p>
