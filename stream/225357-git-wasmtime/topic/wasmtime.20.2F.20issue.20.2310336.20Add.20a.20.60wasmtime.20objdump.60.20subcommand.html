<blockquote>
<p>We talked about this in today's Cranelift meeting but I wanted to write down an issue for this idea. The basic idea is that we have <code>*.cwasm</code> files which have binary tables/metadata in various sections, and we only have <code>objdump -S</code> today to look at the <code>.text</code> section. Otherwise most of our other sections are not easily debuggable. Most sections, however, have something to do with the <code>.text</code> section, so it'd be great to be able to debug all these at the same time.</p>
<p>The general idea is to do something roughly along these lines:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a new subcommand, <code>wasmtime objdump</code>, that takes a <code>*.cwasm</code> file as input.</li>
<li>This primarily either use Capstone to disassemble the <code>.text</code> section or invokes <code>llvm-objdump</code> or <code>objdump</code> or similar. My preference would be to use Capstone to have deterministic output regardless of what's installed on the system.</li>
<li>Disasembly would then be printed in a manner similar to <code>objdump -S</code>, one line per instructions. The main difference is that we would weave debug views of other tables at the same time.</li>
<li>For example<code>.wasmtime.traps</code> would be interleaved as <code>;; trap = CODE</code> after each instruction</li>
<li>Another example is <code>.wasmtime.addrmap</code> would ineterleave <code>;; @0x0FF537</code> to show where the instruction maps back to the original binary location.</li>
<li>The reach goal would be to integrate both stack maps and exception tables from the exception-handling proposal into this view as well. That'd ideally make it much easier to view and debug issues with stack maps and exception tables.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally this view would then be used for all <code>disas</code> tests instead of today's "just use capstone". We could then add various <code>--flags</code> to this subcommand to customize exactly what's disassembled (everything? just stack maps? nothing?) along with other options like "print the instruction bytes" etc</p>

<p>One more thought: once we do this, then one of the main reasons for our continued use of actual ELF as an on-disk container format -- convenient use of other tools like <code>objdump</code> -- goes away. We've had various user questions and confusion over the years that result from our use of ELF -- superficially it looks like Wasmtime AOT compilation produces "just an object/executable" that can be linked in to another program, or run on its own. In order to avoid that confusion, maybe it makes sense to switch to something not-quite-ELF. My favorite idea so far is to switch the magic from <code>\x7FELF</code> to <code>WELF</code> ("Wasm ELF"). (To evaluate: does this impact gdb or perf's implicit understanding of the image mapped in? If so, probably not worth it.)</p>

<p>It would definitely impact LLDB's ability to understand the registered "JIT images", unless we give up on the opportunity to use mapped memory as-is (it is currently being copied, so it's not a problem to mutate the header in the copy, but this copy should ideally be unnecessary).</p>
<p>Besides <code>objdump</code>, there is also <code>[llvm-]dwarfdump</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While a niche use case I do think this would affect <code>perf</code>, specifically in the case where <code>deserialize_file</code> is used to map <code>*.cwasm</code> from disk into the address space that works as-is with <code>perf</code> surprisingly well (I think because it looks like a dlopen'd library). I suspect if we changed the header <code>perf</code> would stop using it by deafult and such frames would turn into <code>[unknown]</code>. The other "niche" part of this use case is that perf-based integration in Wasmtime requires that <code>perf</code> is recording before the module is compiled,  so if you attach <code>perf</code> to a process after-the-fact the <code>perf</code> integration of Wasmtime doesn't work. </p>
<p>Basically tl;dr; I do think that changing away from ELF entirely would break <code>perf</code>-attach-to-preexisting process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We could have a Wasm module that has one custom section whose contents are the existing ELF <code>.cwasm</code>s, and then when we map it, we map only the custom section. I think that gives us both our existing mappability and hides that we are internally using ELF from unsuspecting users.</p>
<p>Whether that is worth the trouble, however...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh that's a good point that the container-on-disk doesn't have to be what we map-in-process, it's always possible to map a subset of the container. I'll note though that the offset has to be page-aligned which means on aarch64 the container has to be at least 64k large to accomodate all page sizes which is relatively hefty to add to all files...</p>
<p>Personally I like having a native object for debugging purposes still in the sense that even if we have <code>wasmtime objdump</code> sometimes it's just more convenient to use native tooling (e.g. <code>llvm-objdump</code> might support more RISC-V instructions than Capstone)</p>
