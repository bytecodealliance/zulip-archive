<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>As the title says, the ability to optionally append a prefix (or suffix, doesn't matter which really) to the output <code>JitDump</code> or <code>PerfMap</code> files when profiling is enabled.</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>The main benefit would be to allow for wasmtime to live in a process that has another different JIT engine inside of it that also emits a perf map or jitdump files.</p>
<p>While this is a niche use case, i've run into needing it myself on a few occasions, primarily when doing Python &lt;-&gt; Rust &lt;-&gt; WASM interop, as Python also emits perf map (or jitdump) files. </p>
<p>Granted this would need post-processing, but that would need to happen regardless as <code>perf</code> on linux makes the (likely sane) assumption that only one JIT runtime will be in any given process.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>Implementation wise, it wouldn't be too complex, the <code>jitdump</code> and <code>perfmap</code> profiling agents could take an <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> for the file prefix/suffix, and then just update the file name with that. The <code>ProfilingStrategy</code> enum would either need an API breaking change to add said <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> to the <code>PerfMap</code>/<code>JitDump</code> elements or have 2 new "prefixed" variants added that take just the <code>T</code>.</p>
<p>In the case of the <code>PerfMapAgent</code>, we would also likely want to prefix <code>wasm::</code> to the sanitized name entries to properly namespace it, i've not looked too much into the <code>JitDumpAgent</code> but it would likely need a similar change. </p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>The primary alternative would be to not use this, and have each hosted JIT use a different method, one perf map and the other JIT dump, however, the <code>perf</code> tools will only really use the input from one or the other because as mentioned previously <code>perf</code> assumes only one JIT per process.</p>
<p>This also applies to doing the JIT dump processing and then trying to apply a perf map file to it after.</p>
<h4>Example</h4>
<p>Here is a screenshot for a locally patched version of wasmtime I had to use in order to get the wanted behaviour, showing a use case for this specific feature, in this case it is Python and wasmtime both emitting a perf map file, which I then post-process to namespace the WASM map and then merge them into a single perf map file prior to using <code>perf report</code></p>

<p>For perfmap would it work if both Wasmtime and Python open the perfmap file in append mode and try to atomically write a full entry at a time? That way you wouldn't need any post processing I think. That wouldn't work for jitdump though.</p>

<p>In Pythons case it makes the very much sane assumption that it is the only thing writing to the perf map file.</p>
<p>Plus there might be contention when flushing the file contents regardless, so I don't think that's a very viable option. </p>

<p>If you only buffer full entries that wouldn't matter. At worst you did get a non-deterministic order, not corrupt entries.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I guess nobody thought about having multiple jits in the same process when they designed this interface, so now everyone has to add workarounds. I presume the same kind of issues would occur if you try to use Python and C# or a javascript engine in the same process.</p>

<p>For perfmap support unforunately this isn't something we can fix I believe. Perf itself <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9b332cece987ee1790b2ed4c989e28162fa47860/tools/perf/Documentation/jit-interface.txt#L4">hardcodes the filename</a>. Similarly for jitdump <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/9b332cece987ee1790b2ed4c989e28162fa47860/tools/perf/util/jitdump.c#L749-L753">the filename to be recognized is hardcoded</a>. Given that all we can really do I think is what @bjorn3 is suggestion, which is to open files in <code>O_APPEND</code> mode and write out entire entries at once.</p>

<p>Hence why I was suggesting a prefixed or postfixed variant so that it could be post-processed as needed.</p>
<p>But looking at the current implementation in Python that looks like they also open in append mode:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/728d239e57b650c392517b7ae569b0eb05af826e/Python/sysmodule.c#L2674-L2703">https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/728d239e57b650c392517b7ae569b0eb05af826e/Python/sysmodule.c#L2674-L2703</a></p>
<p>So maybe that would be the best way, assuming the "namespacing" of the wasm entries is done,</p>
<p>While I would still personally like to be able to split it out, if this is the better solution then that works.<br>

<blockquote>
<p>Is your goal to separate out the profiles so wasm stacks are excluded, for example when you're profiling Python? or vice-versa? Or is the goal to be able to profile everything together? In some ways our hands are tied here as we don't really want to maintain/recommend nonstandard tooling for post-processing files (it's already confusing enough as is sort of...) so if it works for you to have everything in one file I think then that it's basically on us to work with preexisting files and ensure that we append entire records at once and fail if a partial write is ever done.</p>

<p>Ideally It would have been nice to be able to have them seperate if I wanted to look at wasm-only or Python-only, but honestly, as long as the wasm entries are properly prefixed (with <code>wasm::</code> or something, as Python does <code>py::</code>) then they can be split out after if needed and it's not a huge deal.</p>
