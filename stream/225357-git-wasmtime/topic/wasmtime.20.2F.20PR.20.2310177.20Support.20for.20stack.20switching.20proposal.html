<p>frank-emrich opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10177">PR #10177</a> from <code>dhil:stack-switching</code> to <code>bytecodealliance:main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This PR adds support for the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/stack-switching">Wasm stack switching proposal</a>. The explainer document for the proposal is <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/stack-switching/blob/main/proposals/stack-switching/Explainer.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>This means that the following instructions are added: <code>cont.new</code>, <code>resume</code>, <code>suspend</code>, <code>cont.bind</code>.<br>
The instruction <code>resume.throw</code>, which is part of the proposal but relies on exception handling, is currently unsupported.</p>
<p>This was developed together with @dhil.</p>
<h3>General implementation notes</h3>
<p>In Wasm, continuations are represented by values of type <code>(ref $ct)</code>, where <code>$ct</code> is a new composite type/heap type for continuations.<br>
In the implementation, these are represented by values of type <code>VMContObj</code>. These are fat pointers, consisting of a sequence counter, and a pointer to a <code>VMContRef</code>. The latter type is used for the actual representation of continuations.<br>
The sequence counter part of <code>VMContObj</code>s is used to check that every continuation value can only be used once.</p>
<p>The <code>StoreOpaque</code> is extended to contain a "stack chain": It indicates what stack we are currently executing on. Logically, this is a linked list of stacks, since each continuation has a parent field. The chain stored in the <code>StoreOpaque</code> always ends with a value representing the initial stack. This is the stack we were on when entering Wasm, which will usually be the main stack. </p>
<h3>Memory Management</h3>
<p>Currently, memory management is very basic: The <code>StoreOpaque</code> provides a new method for allocation a new <code>VMContRef</code>, and keeps track of all continuations created this way. Continuations are never deallocated at the moment, meaning that they live until the store itself is deallocated. </p>
<p>The stack memory used by each allocation (represented by type <code>ContinuationStack</code>) is always <code>mmap</code>-ed, with a guard page at the end. There is currently no support for growing stacks, or segmented stacks.</p>
<h3>Backtrace generation</h3>
<p>The existing backtrace generation mechanism is extended to be fully aware of continuations: When generating backtraces, the entire chain of continuation is traversed, not just the stack frames of the currently active stack/continuation.</p>
<h3>Integration with GC</h3>
<p>Integration with the GC proposal is limited, but should at least be safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programs where continuation objects would be stored inside GC objects (structs, arrays, ...) are rejected</li>
<li>During GC, all stack frames of all continuations are inspected when looking for GC roots.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Entering/Exiting Wasm</h3>
<p>Before this PR, there are two separate mechanism that save and restore some state of the runtime when entering/exiting Wasm:</p>
<ol>
<li>The functions <code>enter_wasm</code> and <code>exit_wasm</code> in <code>func.rs</code></li>
<li><code>CallThreadState</code> saves and restores (on <code>drop</code>) parts of the <code>VMRuntimeLimits</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This PR consolidates these two mechanism, because it requires some additional state to be updated and restored on enter/exit:<br>
the type <code>wasmtime::runtime::func::RuntimeEntryState</code> now stores all of the required runtime state and ensures that it's restored when exiting Wasm.</p>
<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>Since the stack switching proposal extends the notion of tags introduced by the exception handling proposal, it adds the necessary machinery for importing, exporting, and defining tags.<br>
</p>

<li>There are some build failures due to the new instructions not being supported on all platforms. In general, we've added a Wasm feature and a cargo feature for stack switching.

That's easy to do for the <code>all</code> test suite, but I'm not sure what the best approach is for the <code>wast</code> tests to achieve this. Am I understanding correctly that the <code>wast</code> test suite always currently runs all tests, independently from what cargo features are enabled?</li>

<p>As a general, so far most of the stack switching code is compiled even if the cargo feature is disabled. It would be possible to get more aggressive with conditional compilation, but this requires some ugly special casing in <code>backtrace.rs</code>.

<p>frank-emrich edited <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10177">PR #10177</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This PR adds support for the <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/stack-switching">Wasm stack switching proposal</a>. The explainer document for the proposal is <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/stack-switching/blob/main/proposals/stack-switching/Explainer.md">here</a>.</p>
<p>This means that the following instructions are added: <code>cont.new</code>, <code>resume</code>, <code>suspend</code>, <code>switch</code>, and <code>cont.bind</code>.<br>
The instruction <code>resume.throw</code>, which is part of the proposal but relies on exception handling, is currently unsupported.</p>
<p>This was developed together with @dhil.</p>
<h3>General implementation notes</h3>
<p>In Wasm, continuations are represented by values of type <code>(ref $ct)</code>, where <code>$ct</code> is a new composite type/heap type for continuations.<br>
In the implementation, these are represented by values of type <code>VMContObj</code>. These are fat pointers, consisting of a sequence counter, and a pointer to a <code>VMContRef</code>. The latter type is used for the actual representation of continuations.<br>
The sequence counter part of <code>VMContObj</code>s is used to check that every continuation value can only be used once.</p>
<p>The <code>StoreOpaque</code> is extended to contain a "stack chain": It indicates what stack we are currently executing on. Logically, this is a linked list of stacks, since each continuation has a parent field. The chain stored in the <code>StoreOpaque</code> always ends with a value representing the initial stack. This is the stack we were on when entering Wasm, which will usually be the main stack. </p>
<h3>Memory Management</h3>
<p>Currently, memory management is very basic: The <code>StoreOpaque</code> provides a new method for allocation a new <code>VMContRef</code>, and keeps track of all continuations created this way. Continuations are never deallocated at the moment, meaning that they live until the store itself is deallocated. </p>
<p>The stack memory used by each allocation (represented by type <code>ContinuationStack</code>) is always <code>mmap</code>-ed, with a guard page at the end. There is currently no support for growing stacks, or segmented stacks.</p>
<h3>Backtrace generation</h3>
<p>The existing backtrace generation mechanism is extended to be fully aware of continuations: When generating backtraces, the entire chain of continuation is traversed, not just the stack frames of the currently active stack/continuation.</p>
<h3>Integration with GC</h3>
<p>Integration with the GC proposal is limited, but should at least be safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programs where continuation objects would be stored inside GC objects (structs, arrays, ...) are rejected</li>
<li>During GC, all stack frames of all continuations are inspected when looking for GC roots.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Entering/Exiting Wasm</h3>
<p>Prior to this PR, there were two separate mechanisms that save and restore some state of the runtime when entering/exiting Wasm:</p>
<ol>
<li>The functions <code>enter_wasm</code> and <code>exit_wasm</code> in <code>func.rs</code></li>
<li><code>CallThreadState</code> saves and restores (on <code>drop</code>) parts of the <code>VMRuntimeLimits</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This PR consolidates these two mechanism, because it requires some additional state to be updated and restored on enter/exit:<br>
the type <code>wasmtime::runtime::func::RuntimeEntryState</code> now stores all of the required runtime state and ensures that it's restored when exiting Wasm.</p>
<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>Since the stack switching proposal extends the notion of tags introduced by the exception handling proposal, it adds the necessary machinery for importing, exporting, and defining tags.</p>
<h3>Limitations</h3>
<p>The limitations are as follows, some of which were mentioned above:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>resume.throw</code> needs to be implemented once exception handling is there</li>
<li>Full integration with GC and support for deallocating continuations</li>
<li>The only supported platform at the moment are unix-like x64 systems. I'm planning to change that soon as follow-up PRs, this won't require big changes to what's in this PR at the moment.</li>
<li>Neither Winch or Pulley are supported at the moment.<br>
</li>
</ul>

<p>That is correct, and we assert that tests that "should" fail do in fact fail. This way, if we fix bugs or expand support, we won't accidentally and silently miss out on tests for those things.</p>
<p>This should be fine for your stack switching tests, as long as you</p>
<ul>
<li>mark the tests as "should fail" on supported platforms, and</li>
<li>return an error or some sort (rather than unsafely segfault or whatever) when processing Wasm that uses this proposal on an unsupported platform/configuration.</li>

<p>Oh sorry I should have left a note here but I think I forgot. I was out last week for a company offsite and I'm out this week for the CG meeting, but I plan on getting to this next week. I want to make sure I've got plenty of time to sit down and go through this, but wanted to give a heads-up that I'll be looking into it next week at the earliest.</p>
<p>Also to reiterate: thank you so much for this! Thanks for wrestling with CI as well, much appreciated!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Ok I think I've seen about half of the files of this PR (excluding auto-updates in tests) so wanted to leave an initial round of comments/thoughts.</p>
<p>At a high-level everything here looks reasonable to me so far. I haven't dug into the actual implementation details of stack switching though and have for this been focusing on the integration points with the rest of Wasmtime. I left a lot of comments along the lines of "file an issue to point a comment to this" and I think it might make the most sense to have a single tracking issue for follow-up work on stack-switching. That can have a lot of various checkboxes for the logical work items remaining (e.g. contref in the gc heap, in the embedding API, windows support, etc).</p>
<p>Additionally at a high-level I want to also ask you what your own time allowance is for landing this? This is, as expected, a large PR which is going to take some time to land. I suspect it'll take me on the order of ~days of review to get through the the real "meat" of stack switching and I'll likely have comments from all that as well. If, however, you're running short on time for this that's ok too!</p>
<p>Basically what I want to ask is: do you have time allocated for the back-and-forth of review here? It's hard to predict exactly how long it will take but my gut is that it'll be a nontrivial amount of time. If you don't have time for this I think that's also totally ok. I'll probably still continue to review all this and I'll try to find time in the coming future to work on addressing many of these items myself. </p>
<p>In an ideal world this PR would be split up into chunks and landed piecemeal, for example parsing support, then compiling support, then maybe an instruction-at-a-time for each piece, etc. Splitting this up is no easy task though so I don't want to ask this lightly of you, and you also know much better than I about if it even could be split up and where it could be split.  Part of this is that GitHub does not make reviewing large PRs easy (e.g. every time I add a comment it takes ~5 seconds for the comment box to appear), and overall it's easier to focus on smaller changes to ensure that as little as possible slips through the cracks.</p>
<p>Basically tl;dr; I've left a lot of comments below but it doesn't have to be you alone addressing them. If you're running low on time to allocate to this work I think we can try to be accomodating in assisting to landing this.</p>

<p>I think it's fine to leave this as-is, the <code>#[cfg]</code> here is only to handle the conditionally defined functions on <code>wasmtime::Config</code> but it looks like <code>wasm_stack_switching</code> is unconditionally defined so it's ok to unconditionally thread through the boolean to there here. The <code>wasmtime::Config</code> can then handle validation of ensuring various dependent proposals are all enabled.</p>

<p>For this I might also recommend the <code>isplit</code> instruction which in effect does the same thing but is a bit more efficient to represent. (that takes a 128-bit value and splits it into low/high 64-bit halves)</p>

<p>Tiny note, but we try to avoid <code>as</code> casts where possible because they can be lossy. I haven't made it to <code>stack_switching_environ</code>-the-module yet but to avoid the <code>as</code> cast here you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>If the type is <code>u32</code>-or-smaller, use <code>i64::from(...)</code> instead</li>
<li>If the type is <code>u64</code>, then use <code>CONTROL_EFFECT_RESUME_DISCRIMINANT.signed()</code> to avoid <code>as</code></li>

<p>This I think will need some updates. Endianness should only come into play when storing/loading from memory as opposed to the in-register 128-bit logical value. A CLIF i128 should have the same logical value regardless of platform endianness.</p>
<p>I'm also a bit suspicious of the handling of smaller-than-64-bit platforms both here and below. Overall it seems like this may need some refactoring? To know for sure I'll need to read more of this PR msyelf</p>

<p>For this, similar to above, I'd recommend using <code>iconcat</code> instead of a sequence of or/shift/bor/etc. That should be a bit easier to generate good code for and have the same logical result.</p>
<p>Also, like above, ideally endianness shouldn't factor into this helper at all. I suspect that endianness came into the picture during CI getting s390x working, and if that's the case I can try to help out to debug where the endianness needs to be factored in otherwise.</p>

That would involve changing this function to return <code>Result&lt;u32&gt;</code>, however, and then updating all callers to propagate errors too. Depending on how big a refactoring that is it's also fine to leave this tagged as <code>// FIXME(...)</code> pointing to an issue.</p>

<p>Ah ok I see that this might be why the structures above are defined in this module rather than in the <code>wasmtime</code> crate.</p>
<p>For this though I think we'll want to replace this infrastructure with what we have in <code>VMOffsets</code>. To handle cross-compilation correctly we can't use utilities like <code>size_of</code> or <code>offset_of!</code> here. Instead we have to manually calculate sizes in <code>VMOffsets</code> and then in the <code>wasmtime</code> crate in <code>vmcontext.rs</code> we test all the methods to ensure that the offsets calculated actually match the current host.</p>
<p>This is a relatively large refactoring to all of this support (e.g. instead of <code>const</code>-per-offset it'd be method-per-offset on <code>VMOffsets</code> instead, or <code>HostPtr</code>). In that sense I can also help take care of this too.</p>

<p>One thing perhaps worth pointing out here is that one issue we've seen in the past is that using <code>usize</code> in <code>wasmtime-environ</code> can be a bit funky because <code>wasmtime-environ</code> is used in situations such as cross-compiling where the host/target have differing pointer sizes. If possible this'd ideally use something fixed-size like a <code>u32</code>, but I'm not sure how many other casts that would then require.</p>

<p>One other piece of validation (which might belong in <code>Engine::_check_compatible_with_native_host</code> perhaps) is to ensure that if stack-switching is enabled that <code>#[cfg(feature = "stack-switching")]</code> is also enabled. Otherwise that represents a host that has enabled the wasm feature but not compile-time support so it'd probably be good to return a first-class error in such a situation.</p>

<p>@alexcrichton</p>
<p>Thanks so much for having a look at this already!</p>
<p>Regarding my own time commitment for this PR: I'm starting a new job in mid March, so things are looking as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Until end of February: Focusing exclusively on getting this PR in shape</li>
<li>First two weeks of March: Working on this PR, but some distractions due to moving, etc.</li>
<li>From mid March: There will be an initial period of me settling in at my new job during which I can't do much on this. After that the Wasmtime/stack switching work will not part of my day job anymore, but I'll still be around to help out, address bugs, etc. I also have a few things on top of the current PR already done or planned that I want to add at that stage (aarch64 support, Windows support, better DWARF support, ....).</li>
</ul>
<p>@dhil should also be able to help out here and there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In an ideal world this PR would be split up into chunks and landed piecemeal, for example parsing support, then compiling support, then maybe an instruction-at-a-time for each piece, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there was just a bit of a miscommunication between me and @dhil. I thought you wanted to see this as one big chunk. There's a simple way in which this PR could be split up, leading to a sequence of PRs as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Integrate tag support, with nothing stack switching related, yet.</li>
<li>Add dummy field to VMContext with the size and position that the stack switching field will later occupy. This way, all the changes to the disas tests will happen in this PR. I'm not sure if the disas tests actually contribute to Github choking on this PR, but at least getting them out of the way will reduce the amount of conflicts coming in.</li>
<li>Everything except the actual Wasm -&gt; CLIF translation. This will be a big chunk where most of the integration of stack switching with the rest of Wasmtime goes.</li>
<li>The Wasm -&gt; CLIF translation. This will mostly be what's currently in <code>crates/cranelift/src/stack_switching/</code>, in particular <code>instructions.rs</code>. The latter is 2500 LOC, so reviewing that separately seems worthwhile. I may even be able to split this up further.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is far from perfect because PR 3 and 4 will still be large and not really split along separate features of the stack switching implementation, but at least that split up would be easy for me to do. I may discover some more chunks that can be factored out into separate PRs on the way.</p>
<p>My only concerns about this is the following: Given that Github doesn't really support stacked PRs, we would work through these 4+ PRs linearly, making it difficult to point at why we need something in the next PR.  <br>
On the other hand, I could just put a branch somewhere that shows everything that's still missing at any point so you can have a look at how something will be used in the remaining PRs.</p>
<p>Please let me know what you think. I will also make sure to work through the comments you already added to this PR so they don't get lost if we do decide to split this PR.</p>

<p>This was just a note to ourselves that we made this field <code>pub(crate)</code> because we access it from our code.

<p>Sorry, there's one thing I forgot to mention in the overall PR description: There is currently some debugging logic left in this PR, you will run into it when looking at <code>instructions.rs</code>: We have added <code>emit_debug_println!</code> and <code>emit_debug_assert!</code>. Their implementation is too hacky to keep in the final version that we merge, but I'm hoping to keep them until the very end and only rip them out when the rest of the code is ready. They are incredibly helpful while I may need to make any kind of changes to the code.</p>
<p>Anything that has something like "delete me" in the name is related to this debugging code.<br>

<p>Yes, that's absolutely the reason why some of the types that should morally live in the runtime/wasmtime crate are defined here, just to make these offset definitions easier.</p>
<p>I actually suspected that the module here would have to be merge into (something like) <code>VMOffsets</code>, there's a comment a few lines above saying that.</p>
<p>I'm happy to do that refactoring, but just a few questions:<br>
Should I actually integrate all the offsets for these types here into <code>VMOffsets</code> (or more accurately, the <code>PtrSize</code> trait)? Or was your suggestion to re-create similar infrastructure elsewhere? I'm mostly asking because AFAIK all the types that <code>vmoffsets.rs</code> talks about have the <code>VM*</code> prefix. There's nothing really stopping us from adding that prefix to our own types, but I'm unsure if that prefix carries more meaning and may be inappropriate for our types.<br>

<p>Yes, this is ugly. This is basically just a way of saying "give me the size of a <code>ValRaw</code>", without having access to that type here.<br>
The reason we need that size is that all continuation payloads (arguments to continuations, return values from continuations, values provided by <code>suspend</code>, etc) are currently written to and then read from buffers containing <code>ValRaw</code>. Let's keep this comment open, we will certainly be re-visiting that discussion when you have a look at <code>instructions.rs</code>.</p>

<p>Regarding my own time commitment for this PR</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ok that all sounds good, thanks! (very helpful to set expectations!)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think there was just a bit of a miscommunication between me and @dhil.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh no that's on me. I remember telling @dhil that and I think I was just basically wrong, so that's on me for leading y'all astray. Given the size of this (not just the auto-updated tests but also the scale of the implementation) along with the subtelty of the implementation in retrospect I just didn't account for that and misled y'all. If possible I think the best way to handle this would be to peel off PRs from this one and submit them independently.</p>
<p>Overall my goal is to ensure that we get a good chance to review everything coming in and reducing the chance of something being lost by accident due to being overlooked. For coordination what I would imagine is that it's completely reasonable to have lightly, if at all, tested intermediate states. Additionally it's totally reasonable to leave a "hole" in the code with something like <code>// more coming soon ...</code> (e.g. making a hole in the <code>VMContext</code> for the stack-switching state necessary for a future PR). Let's keep this PR open so it can be cross-referenced if needed, and this can be rebased occasionally as smaller pieces are landed.</p>
<p>Does that seem ok? It's a similar strategy we're taking for landing <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9582">async component model support in Wasmtime</a> where it's landing piece-by-piece. Each piece is not 100% thoroughly tested but the  "final PR" has lots of tests. We try to keep track of outstanding TODO items in issues occasionally and otherwise are ok deferring work to a future PR which has more tests and more fully justifies a prior design.</p>
<p>Your sequence of PRs makes sense to me as well. I'd mostly defer to y'all for pieces to split up as you're the most familiar with the implementation, and if something seems too big I can bring it up during the review but by naturally splitting this up I think most slicing/dicing will be quite reasonable.</p>

<p>Yes, absolutely. I'm happy to do the necessary chopping. I'll create a tracking issue describing the bigger picture and where we currently are regarding the PRs that have and haven't landed at any time.</p>

<p>Sounds good! It's ok to skip the step of writing out a plan in an issue and then executing on the plan, we can work on making sure things are documented before you wind down but up until then it's ok if it's just in a few heads. In that sense no need to exhaustively document "here's the round peg that's gonna fit in that round hole" and we can just have one issue for tracking known items that are already in-tree.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>This comment is actually still applicable, but it's a relatively minor point.</p>
<p>What's happening here is the following: For the translation of some instructions, like <code>resume</code>, we need access to the <code>VMRuntimeLimits</code>. That means that if a Wasm function contains certain instructions, we would like to use the the <code>vmruntime_limits_ptr</code> <code>ir::Value</code> in <code>FuncEnvironment</code>.<br>
However, the code here must decide whether or not to call <code>declare_vmruntime_limits_ptr</code> without knowing if the function body contains such an instruction (and it seems like a bad idea to traversing the body of the function just for this).</p>
<p>What we currently do is just to re-load the pointer to the <code>VMRuntimeLimits</code> every time we need it (basically just inlining the same <code>load</code> as the one in <code>declare_vmruntime_limits_ptr</code>) and hoping that the optimizer may catch cases where we do this more than once per function.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it's worth to update <code>declare_vmruntime_limits_ptr</code> so that it doesn't define <code>vmruntime_limits_ptr</code> in the function prelude, but instead make it an <code>Option</code> that's set the first time someone needs the value.</p>

<p>A tag is more than a wasm type. It is a nominal entity and its unique identity is important. Basically we get a unique identity by picking backing on pointer equality.</p>

<h4>Label Messager: wasmtime:config</h4>
<p>It looks like you are changing Wasmtime's configuration options. Make sure to<br>
complete this check list:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[ ] If you added a new <code>Config</code> method, you wrote extensive documentation for<br>
      it.</p>
<p>&lt;details&gt;</p>
<p>Our documentation should be of the following form:</p>
<p>```text<br>
Short, simple summary sentence.</p>
<p>More details. These details can be multiple paragraphs. There should be<br>
information about not just the method, but its parameters and results as<br>
well.</p>
<p>Is this method fallible? If so, when can it return an error?</p>
<p>Can this method panic? If so, when does it panic?</p>
<h1>Example</h1>
<p>Optional example here.<br>
```</p>
<p>&lt;/details&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ ] If you added a new <code>Config</code> method, or modified an existing one, you<br>
  ensured that this configuration is exercised by the fuzz targets.</p>
<p>&lt;details&gt;</p>
<p>For example, if you expose a new strategy for allocating the next instance<br>
slot inside the pooling allocator, you should ensure that at least one of our<br>
fuzz targets exercises that new strategy.</p>
<p>Often, all that is required of you is to ensure that there is a knob for this<br>
configuration option in [<code>wasmtime_fuzzing::Config</code>][fuzzing-config] (or one<br>
of its nested <code>struct</code>s).</p>
<p>Rarely, this may require authoring a new fuzz target to specifically test this<br>
configuration. See [our docs on fuzzing][fuzzing-docs] for more details.</p>
<p>&lt;/details&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[ ] If you are enabling a configuration option by default, make sure that it<br>
  has been fuzzed for at least two weeks before turning it on by default.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Should I actually integrate all the offsets for these types here into VMOffsets (or more accurately, the PtrSize trait)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah let's do that. That's the conventional location we have for dealing with offsets-of-things in compiled code, so I think keeping it all in one place is best.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There's nothing really stopping us from adding that prefix to our own types, but I'm unsure if that prefix carries more meaning and may be inappropriate for our types.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh no special meaning yeah, just our convention for "this datatype is read by both compiled code and the host" and then we try to group things together where it makes sense</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I think we need some knobs for continuation stacks, e.g. limit the number of allocated stacks. I think the stack size can be useful, but perhaps its use is rather limited until we have implemented growable stacks. I think we also want to land a pooling allocator for continuation stacks, as it is necessary to obtain decent performance on the workloads we have been benchmarking. </p>
<p>Though, I'd be quite happy to simply use <code>wasm_stack_size</code> and keep the specific stack switching config downstream for now.</p>
