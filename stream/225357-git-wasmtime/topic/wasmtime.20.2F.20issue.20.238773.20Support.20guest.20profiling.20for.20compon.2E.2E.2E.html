<p>yoshuawuyts opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8773">issue #8773</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>Enable the following to work:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Bash"><pre><span></span><code>wasmtime<span class="w"> </span>serve<span class="w"> </span>./my-component.wasm<span class="w"> </span>--profile<span class="o">=</span>guest
</code></pre></div>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>In general: profiling is useful and it's neat to be able to profile wasm components.</p>
<p>For me specifically though: I'm on MacOS and setting up native trace tools requires turning off security features in the kernel. I've not been able to do so successfully, so as a result I (somewhat embarrassingly) don't currently have a working <code>perf</code> command on my machine. Because wasmtime's guest profiler doesn't interact with the kernel at all, this seems like the ideal way to resolve it, basically by providing a portable, OS-agnostic profiling suite.</p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>There is a working guest profiler available already, but trying to run it on components gives the following error message:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Text only"><pre><span></span><code>Error: Cannot use the guest profiler with components
</code></pre></div>
<p>I don't really have insight in what it would take to implement support for components. But I figured it would be desirable - and I didn't see it being tracked already, so I figured we should. Folks with more knowledge about the challenges here should probably chime in though.<br>

<p>I'm starting to look at this now; in my brief test I'm not seeing the same error related to components but I'm also not seeing results that look correct which seems to be backed up by the code only registering directly present core modules rather than those used as part of components.</p>

<p>EDIT: I do see that <code>bail!</code> on the <code>serve</code> branch; <code>run</code> behaves differently (but probably should have an explicit error like serve given its seeming non-function).</p>
