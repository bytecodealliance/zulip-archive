<blockquote>
<p>Wasmtime's current modeling of canonical ABI options is quite messy and quite <code>unsafe</code>-prone. We should improve this on both axes ideally. </p>
<p>One example of how things are messy right now is that while there's an <code>Options</code> type within Wasmtime that's not used pervasively. That means that modeling a call to a lowered function has no "options identifier" to pass along meaning that all options are passed individually. This means that the type signature of a host-lowered function in Wasmtime has no less than <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/5bb5d0080c97d291a7127436884cc50cce084716/crates/wasmtime/src/runtime/vm/component.rs#L163-L175">11 function parameter</a>. This is messy because it's onerous to add more parameters over time just to get plumbed around and it means that passing around options is unnecessarily expensive.</p>
<p>Passing all of these options individually is additionally quite <code>unsafe</code>-heavy because it's a bunch of raw pointers getting thrown around. This means that all users effectively have no ability to be safe and are required to be tagged as <code>unsafe</code> functions. Everywhere from the entrypoint to the creation of <code>Options</code> is effectively unsafe with the documentation being "hey I'm just the messenger don't shoot me". Connecting these two across large distances is not always easy to do.</p>
<hr>
<p>A solution I would propose would look something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change the compilation process to "intern" canonical ABI options. Compiled component metadata would then have <code>PrimaryMap&lt;OptionsIndex, Options&gt;</code> or something like that.</li>
<li>Change <code>VMLoweringCallee</code> to <code>fn(vmctx: NonNull&lt;VMOpaqueContext&gt;, data: NonNull&lt;u8&gt;, options: u32, args_and_results: NonNull&lt;mem::MaybeUninit&lt;ValRaw&gt;&gt;, nargs_and_results: usize) -&gt; bool;</code>. Effectively compress almost everything into <code>options: u32</code> which is an <code>OptionsIndex</code>.</li>
<li>Change the constructor of <code>Options</code> today to take an <code>OptionsIndex</code> instead of a bunch of parameters individually. This means that internally <code>Options</code> will have some <code>unsafe</code> code, but it will be scoped to just that set of options and <code>Options</code> additionally now carries "proof" that it's valid (it came from a trusted location, the compiler, it's not a bunch of arbitrary values).</li>
</ul>
<p>There might be further cleanup from there perhaps? This is particularly going to affect component model async bits as well, but it may not make sense to intern all options there just yet. Some information present in lowered host functions is irrelevant for async bits, for example the component model type doesn't exist for intrinsics. Ideally though everything would use the same interning system.</p>
