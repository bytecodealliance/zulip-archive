<p>fitzgen opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10456">PR #10456</a> from <code>fitzgen:issue-10397</code> to <code>bytecodealliance:main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were previously propagating the needs-inclusion-in-stack-maps bit from a variable to the values resulting from <code>builder.use_var(my_var)</code> and passed to <code>builder.def_var(my_var, my_val)</code>. However, that does not cover every <code>ir::Value</code> generated for a given <code>ir::Variable</code>: it is missing block parameters that the SSA builder inserted and which are <em>not</em> then used directly as the result of <code>use_var</code>, but instead passed as arguments another block, and that block's parameter is then directly or indirectly used as the result of <code>builder.use_var(...)</code>. This chaining can go arbitrarily deep, based on the program's control flow. By not marking these block parameters as needing inclusion in stack maps, our stack maps would be incomplete, which meant that the GC could too-eagerly collect objects, which meant that we would then get use-after-free bugs.</p>
<p>The solution is for the <code>SSABuilder</code> to report all the block parameters that it inserted, and for which <code>ir::Variable</code> it inserted them. We already have a summary of the mutations that an <code>SSABuilder</code> performed, <code>SideEffects</code>, and which must be handled by the <code>FunctionBuilder</code> after, e.g., sealing a block, so we add this block-param-and-var information to it. Now, after the <code>FunctionBuilder</code> has the <code>SSABuilder</code> do its thing, it handles fixing up not only the modified blocks' status, which it was doing before, but also propagates the needs-inclusion-in-stack-maps metadata from variables to all those freshly-inserted block parameter values.</p>
<p>After this change, we successfully include <em>all</em> of a needs-inclusion-in-stack-maps variable's values in stack maps, which avoids the over-eager object reclamation and associated GC heap corruption.</p>
<p>Fixes #10397</p>
