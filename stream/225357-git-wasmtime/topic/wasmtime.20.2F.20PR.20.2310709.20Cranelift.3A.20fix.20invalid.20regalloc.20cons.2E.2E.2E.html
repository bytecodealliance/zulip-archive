<p>cfallin opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10709">PR #10709</a> from <code>cfallin:fix-try-call-with-empty-handlers</code> to <code>bytecodealliance:main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Reported by @bjorn3 -- thanks!)</p>
<p>We handle edge splitting for regalloc moves in a way that is designed to split minimally (for copmiler performance and codegen quality): we only split edges that are truly critical, i.e., come from a block with more than one successor and go to a block with more than one predecessor. In all other cases, there is always a place for these moves to go: if a block only has one successor, then edge-moves can go before its jump; and if a block only has one predecessor, then edge-moves can go at the beginning of that block (before the blockparams' parallel-move). The former case -- before the branch -- works because of a restriction that regalloc2 imposes: branches with only one target (that is, unconditional branches) cannot have any arguments. Otherwise, those uses would occur after the edge-moves have already shuffled the register state into a state suitable for the next block. Violating this constraint leads to a panic.</p>
<p>With ordinary unconditional branches, this is no problem. With <code>try_call</code>s with at least one handler listed, this is also no problem: such a terminator is seen as a branch with (at least) two targets by regalloc, so no edge-moves are placed before it, so it's allowed to have arguments, such as the arguments to the call itself. However, a <code>try_call</code> with <em>no</em> handler clauses, though pathological, appears to regalloc as an unconditional branch and so should not have any arguments. The included test-case triggers this issue with such a <code>try_call</code> together with a normal-return target branch that has more than one incoming edge, forcing the location for the moves into the <code>try_call</code>'s block. (The lack of actual edge-moves doesn't matter -- RA2 performs the check on the IR restriction first.) The result is a panic at compile time.</p>
<p>This PR fixes the issue by extending a similar fix for <code>br_table</code>s (which can trigger a very similar bug if they have only the default case, i.e., one target) to <code>try_call{,_indirect}</code> as well: the lowered-block order computation, where edge-splits are determined, pretends that they always have at least two successors. This ensures that edges will be split as necessary, satisfying the no-arguments-to-unconditional-terminators restriction.</p>
