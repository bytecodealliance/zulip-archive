<p>alexcrichton <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/10075#issuecomment-2607816368">commented</a> on <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/10075">issue #10075</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The documentation here more-or-less outlines why the <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> crate (and <code>wasmtime-wasi-http</code>) don't compile on no_std platforms. They both currently have a hard requirement on the <code>tokio</code> runtime which AFAIK has no "custom platform" support along similar lines as to Wasmtime.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though there's not necessarily a super-small C API we can offer and say "implement this and you get all of WASI". What I might recommend instead is to avoid using the <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> crate entirely and build-your-own. The <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> crate, for example, is built exclusively on the public API of the <code>wasmtime</code> crate which does build for no_std with custom platform support. This would mean that when building your own WASI implementation to run on your own custom OS you'd be using <code>Linker</code> yourself to add all your own functions and such.</p>
<p>I'll note that this is also not the greatest state of things as reimplementing the <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> crate is a relatively significant undertaking. If you only want a few functions it might not be so bad but WASI has a relatively large surface area. That being said this large surface area is also why it's not feasible to provide a small/turnkey solution to a custom platform because there would be so many insertion points.</p>
<p>If it works for your use case I might recommend providing only a few WASI interfaces and grow that set over time. For example you probably want <code>wasi:io</code> primitives and maybe others like <code>wasi:clocks</code> and <code>wasi:random</code>, and those shouldn't be too too hard to port to a custom platform implementation.</p>
<p>Finally I'll also note that @pchickey is <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10036">doing work</a> to get <code>wasi:io</code> working on no_std so you might be interested in that as well.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Agree with Alex - its very hard to come up with a pluggable implementation of WASI that meets the needs of different platforms while still having enough in common across platforms to be worthwhile.</p>
<p>The wasmtime-wasi-io crate, which <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10036">just landed in main</a>, is a no_std implementation of the WASI poll function, and a set of traits for input-stream, output-stream, and pollable. Its just barely enough common ground for implementations to be worth having at all.</p>
<p>Once you have that, you still have to build up a lot of other functionality to be able to embed apps that use stdin/out, sockets, etc, and how you do so is heavily dependent on your underlying platform. My suggestion is to invoke <code>wasmtime::component::bindgen!</code> yourself with <code>with: { "wasi:io": wasmtime_wasi_io::bindings::wasi::io }</code> and then just start writing your own impl Hosts. There's a small amount of common boilerplate in most impl Hosts for handling ResourceTable manipulation, but abstracting that away ends up requiring manually writing a trait that basically looks like a HostSomeResource minus one argument, which is more of a burden to maintain as common infra than I think its worth. (But maybe its something you could add an option to bindgen to write for you, if you're motivated?)</p>

<p>At some point in the future I will add an example app that uses wasmtime-wasi-io to make a sample embedding, but right now I'm burning down other things on my critical path so that remains tech debt for today.</p>
