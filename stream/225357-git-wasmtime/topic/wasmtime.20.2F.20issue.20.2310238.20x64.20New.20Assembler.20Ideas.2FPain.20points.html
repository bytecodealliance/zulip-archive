</blockquote>
<p>Hm... while I think the ISLE integration certainly can be improved, I thought we would want to maintain a clear separation of the "read" and "read-write" types all the way up into ISLE. This allows us to distinguish when we can just pass a <code>cranelift-codegen</code> <code>Gpr</code> and when we must pass the <code>PairedGpr</code> thing <code>(WritableGpr, Gpr)</code>. No?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the latter would return SideEffectNoResult ... should return ValueRegs instead of a single GPR</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was looking at this last week: I thought, "why _must_ we always emit in these ISLE constructors?" If instead we just returned the <code>MInst::External</code> and then had some other way to do the <code>emit</code> part, we could more easily fit in with all these <code>SideEffect*</code>, <code>ProducesFlags*</code>, and <code>ConsumesFlags*</code> structures. So, e.g., to lower instructions directly we would write something like <code>(rule ... (emit (x64_* ...)))</code> but would then need to teach <code>emit</code> to do more. Perhaps <code>emit</code> could call an <code>asm::Inst::emit</code> generated function that knows which of the operands to return?</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I stopped spending much time on fixed registers when I saw we didn't use them much in the lowerings I was looking at. I think for <code>mul</code>, e.g., we not only have registers that are "fixed" but also "implicit," in that they shouldn't appear in disassembly (or at least that's how I'm interpreting <a href="https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/commit/8344547ec80f79b3a5bf201611f734628ad1b83e">https://github.com/alexcrichton/wasmtime/commit/8344547ec80f79b3a5bf201611f734628ad1b83e</a>). I'm not sure I like extending the <code>Regs</code> trait with all kinds of specific registers; why can't we construct a specific register on one side (e.g., assembler) and use its HW encoding to map to the right thing on the other (e.g., <code>cranelift-codegen</code>)? Do we need additional information re: register class?</p>

<p>Sure!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought we would want to maintain a clear separation of the "read" and "read-write" types all the way up into ISLE.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently though ISLE is almost entirely in "SSA form" where the only use of <code>WritableReg</code> is in helpers which insert a <code>WritableReg</code> in to the <code>MInst</code> variants. Almost all instruction signatures don't deal with <code>WritableReg</code>.</p>
<p>In that sense I was thinking that the operands to an instruction should never be writable since everything is modeled as SSA, meaning that by default once something is produce you should lose the writable bit anyway. That means that all operands are <code>AssemblerReadGpr{,Mem}</code>. Additionally results are always <code>AssemblerReadGpr</code> since after it's produced it's not valid to overwrite a value in a register. (this also connects to <code>AssemblerReadGprMem</code> doesn't make sense to me as a result because you can't produce a result that resides in memory, hence my thinking of two ISLE constructors here)</p>
<p>To be clear though I'm not saying we should change the representation of the instructions. What I'm thinking is we change the signatures of the ISLE constructors and the implementation of the constructors (e.g. the generated macro) but that's it. The instructions continue to hold <code>PairedGpr</code> as they do today which matches what <code>MInst</code> is already doing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was looking at this last week: I thought, "why must we always emit in these ISLE constructors?" </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I agree with your points! I was looking at <code>adc</code> briefly and integrating it with the external assembler seemed tricky because it was going to be hard to get the <code>MInst</code>.</p>
<p>To me the hard part here is that ISLE doesn't easily support returning pairs of values. Constructors in theory need to return both the result (e.g. <code>AssemblerReadGpr</code>) as well as the instruction (<code>MInst::External</code>). Right now they only return the <code>AssemblerReadGpr</code> and eject the <code>MInst</code> out-the-side. My best thinking for handling this is that we'd probably want flags on the <code>inst</code> constructor in the DSL to say something like "this consumes flags" or "this both consumes and produces flags" and that generates various variants of ISLE constructors automatically. More-or-less side-stepping the problem of working with <code>MInst</code> by generating more constructors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure I like extending the Regs trait with all kinds of specific registers; why can't we construct a specific register on one side (e.g., assembler) and use its HW encoding to map to the right thing on the other (e.g., cranelift-codegen)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm not sure I quite understand what you're thinking here, could you elaborate?</p>
<p>What I'm thinking is that on the cranelift-codegen side we fundamentally have a vreg rather than an actual register. During register allocation that'll get fixed to a particular register but the representation of the instruction has to have a slot for <code>Gpr</code> somewhere inside of it (e.g. <code>mul</code> would somehow contain two <code>WritableGpr</code> and two <code>Gpr</code> values inside of it). My thinking was that the existing <code>ReadGpr</code> and <code>ReadWriteGpr</code> could be used (we'd regardless have to add a <code>WriteGpr</code>) it hinders use cases such as fuzzing where <code>mul</code> is only valid of the results are <code>rax:rdx</code> and plumbing that through to fuzzing to only generate those registers seemed easiest by having a new associated type. I do agree it's not pretty though.</p>

<p>I've been poking at the new x64 assembler and I'm starting to accumulate a number of various things here and there so I wanted to write these down before I forgot. I had a rough high-level goal of "I'd like to implement <code>mul</code> (and <code>imul</code>) instructions" and it led to most of these issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>[ ] Fixed registers don't show up in ISLE right now. We need to represent them as <code>Gpr</code> in Cranelift but something like <code>Rax</code> during fuzzing.</li>
<li>[x] The first argument of many ISLE constructors is <code>AssemblerReadWriteGpr</code> but this technically isn't correct, they should all take <code>AssemblerReadGpr</code> (note the lack of "Write"). (#10276)</li>
<li>[x] Return values from ISLE are <code>AssemblerReadWriteGpr</code>, but like above they should probably be <code>AssemblerReadGpr</code> instead. Basically the "write" part should mostly just be an internal detail that the ISLE bindings don't expose. (#10276)</li>
<li>[x] Instructions that modify memory, such as <code>x64_addb_mi</code>, should probably have two constructors in ISLE: one for the version that modifies a register and one that modifies memory. The former would return <code>AssemblerReadGpr</code> and the latter would return <code>SideEffectNoResult</code>. (#10276)</li>
<li>[ ] Instructions that return multiple results, such as <code>mul</code>, should return <code>ValueRegs</code> instead of a single GPR.</li>
<li>[x] ISLE constructors for new instructions can overlap in priorities when the types are disjoint (e.g. no need to do 1-12, only 1-3 for within one type) (#10260)</li>
<li>[x] Previous ISLE constructors/<code>emit.rs</code> should be removed instead of acting as a catch-all (to help catch mistakes and additionally gradually clean things up) (#10260)</li>
<li>[x] If <code>Assembler*Write*</code> is removed from ISLE bindings (above bullets) then auto-conversions and various methods to/from other ISLE types should be removed as they shouldn't be necessary. (#10276)</li>

<p>I marked the "fixed registers" check box as done up above. We can keep this open for the multi-value return question or we could close &mdash; either is fine with me.</p>
