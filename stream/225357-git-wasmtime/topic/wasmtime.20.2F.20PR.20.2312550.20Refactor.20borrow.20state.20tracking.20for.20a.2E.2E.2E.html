<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/12550">PR #12550</a> from <code>alexcrichton:remove-call-contexts</code> to <code>bytecodealliance:main</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This commit is a somewhat deep refactoring of how the state of<br>
<code>borrow&lt;T&gt;</code> is managed for both the host and the guest with respect to<br>
async tasks. This additionally refactors how some async task management<br>
is done for host-called functions.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem being tackled here is <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/12510">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/12510</a>. In that issue it<br>
was discovered that the way <code>CallContext</code>, the borrow tracking mechanism<br>
in Wasmtime, is managed is incompatible with async tasks. Specifically<br>
the previous assumption of the scope being mutated for a borrow is<br>
somewhere on the call stack is no longer true. It's possible for an<br>
async task to be suspended, for example, and then a sibling task drops a<br>
borrow which should update the scope of the suspended task. There were a<br>
number of other small issues I noticed here and there which this PR<br>
additionally has tests for, all of which failed before this change and<br>
pass afterwards.</p>
<p>The manner in which borrow state is manipulated is a pretty old part of<br>
the component model implementation dating back to the original<br>
implementation of resources. I decided to forgo any possible quick fix<br>
and have attempted to more deeply refactor and integrate async tasks<br>
into all of this infrastructure. A list of the changes made here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <code>CallContexts</code> structure, a stack of <code>CallContext</code>, was removed.<br>
  Tasks now directly store a <code>CallContext</code> which is the source of truth<br>
  for borrow tracking for that call, and it does not move from this<br>
  location. The store <code>CallContexts</code> is now deleted in favor of updating<br>
  the <code>Option&lt;ConcurrentState&gt;</code> in the store to be an <code>enum</code> of either<br>
  concurrent state or a stack. In this manner the old stack-based<br>
  structure is still used sometimes, but it's impossible to reach when<br>
  concurrency is enabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Entry to the host from guests now reliably pushes a <code>HostTask</code> into<br>
  the store. Previously where a frame were always pushed into a<br>
<code>CallContext</code> a <code>HostTask</code> is pushed into the store. This is still<br>
  expected to be a bit too expensive for cheap host calls, but it<br>
  doesn't meaningfully change the performance profile of before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>resource_enter_call</code> and <code>resource_exit_call</code> libcalls have been<br>
  removed. These are now folded into the <code>enter_sync_call</code> and<br>
<code>exit_sync_call</code> libcalls. Emission of these hooks has been updated<br>
  accordingly. The concept of entering a call more generally has been<br>
  removed. This is more formally known in the async world as a task<br>
  starting, so the task creation is now responsible for the demarcation<br>
  of entering a call. Additionally this means that the concept of<br>
  exiting a call has somewhat gone away. Instead this method was renamed<br>
  to <code>validate_scope_exit</code> which double-checks that a borrow-scope can<br>
  be exited but doesn't actually remove the task. Task removal is<br>
  deferred to preexisting mechanisms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Management of a <code>GuestTask</code>'s previous <code>Option&lt;CallContext&gt;</code> field,<br>
  for example taking/restoring and pushing/popping onto <code>CallContexts</code><br>
  is now all gone. All related code is outright deleted as the<br>
<code>GuestTask</code>'s now non-optional <code>CallContext</code> field is the source of truth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>ConcurrentState</code> structure now stores a <code>CurrentThread</code> enum<br>
  instead of <code>Option&lt;QualifiedThreadId&gt;</code>. This represents how the<br>
  currently executing thread could be a host thread, not just a guest<br>
  thread, which is required for borrow-tracking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>HostTask</code> creation in <code>poll_and_block</code> and <code>first_poll</code>, the two main<br>
  entrypoints of async host tasks when called by the guest, is now<br>
  externalized from these functions. Instead these functions assume that<br>
  the currently running thread is already a <code>HostTask</code> of some kind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <code>poll_and_block</code> the host's result is no longer stored in the guest<br>
  task but in the host task instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall this enables the <code>*.wast</code> test for <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/12510">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/12510</a> to fix the original<br>
issue. This then adds new tests to ensure that cleanup of various<br>
constructs happens appropriately, such as cancelling a host task should<br>
clean up its associated resources. Additionally synchronously calling an<br>
async host task no longer leaks resources in a <code>Store</code> and should<br>
properly clean up everything.</p>
<p>There is still more work to do in this area (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/12544">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/12544</a>) but that's<br>
going to be deferred to a future PR at this point.</p>
