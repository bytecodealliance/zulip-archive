<blockquote>
<p>Based on #10616.</p>
<p>Currently, in bindgen-emitted component wrappers, the existence of export functions is checked at the construction of the {interface-name}Indices struct, but each export function is only finally typechecked on their invocation in {interface-name}::call_{func-name}.</p>
<p>The goal of this PR is to typecheck component exports at the construction of Indices. This is desirable because it gives a type error as early as possible - when using Indices by way of {interface-name}Pre, this can be performed with only an InstancePre, where the creation of an InstancePre requires only a Component and Linker, and typechecks all of the Component's imports.

<h2>Additions to Wasmtime</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>InstancePre</code> now has an additional <code>InstanceType</code> member. The <code>InstanceType</code> represents the type information carried in the <code>Linker</code> used to typecheck all of the <code>InstancePre</code>'s imports. This is accessible by a new accessor <code>instance_type(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;InstanceType</code>.</li>
<li><code>Instance</code> has a new accessor <code>instance_type(&amp;self, store: impl AsContextMut) -&gt; InstanceType</code>. The store contains all of the information required to construct the InstanceType, so this is just a matter of exposing whats already there.</li>
<li><code>component::types::ComponentFunc</code> has a new method <code>typecheck&lt;Params, Returns&gt;(&amp;self, instance_type: &amp;InstanceType) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;</code>. The underlying typecheck performed here is the exact same one performed in <code>Func::typed&lt;Params, Returns&gt;(&amp;self, store: impl AsContextMut) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;</code>, except rather than the type information coming out of the store, its provided by the InstanceType.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these additions are pub interfaces but marked <code>#[doc(hidden)]</code> to make them "internal", because the prior art was that <code>InstanceType</code> and is internal, and there are no other public interfaces for retrieving <code>InstanceType</code> or typechecking, with the sole exception of <code>Func::typed</code>. I think that we should consider making these documented public interfaces, but I'll leave that to a future PR unless requested.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Future work</h2>
<p>Each export func is typechecked again in its bindgen <code>call_{funcname}</code> function, in which the <code>Func</code> member owned by the typed instance <code>{Foo}</code> struct is cast to a <code>TypedFunc</code> with the specific type parameters bindgen keeps track of for each func. Since the <code>{Foo}</code> struct is created from a <code>{Foo}Indices</code>, we can guarantee that the export funcs have been typechecked against a given <code>Linker</code> or <code>Store</code>, so we could potentially elide the repeated typecheck there, and make an unchecked cast to TypedFunc instead. (TypedFuncs are not stored in the <code>{Foo}</code> struct at least in part because their type parameters may use <code>&amp;'a ...</code> which only apply to the site of the call, and not to the storage of that member in <code>{Foo}</code>. The <code>for&lt;'a&gt;</code> trick only works for trait objects, not concrete types like TypedFunc.)</p>

<p>Currently, in bindgen-emitted component wrappers, the existence of export functions is checked at the construction of the {interface-name}Indices struct, but each export function is only finally typechecked on their invocation in {interface-name}::call_{func-name}.</p>
<p>The goal of this PR is to typecheck component exports at the construction of Indices. This is desirable because it gives a type error as early as possible - when using {interface-name}Indices by way of {interface-name}Pre, this can be performed with only an InstancePre, where the creation of an InstancePre requires only a Component and Linker, and typechecks all of the Component's imports. So, really, this is about getting exports on parity with imports.</p>
<p>Closes #9155 . I've worked around this with ugly hacks in embeddings for 2 different employers now and I'm not about to do it for a third.</p>
<h2>Additions to Wasmtime</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>InstancePre</code> now has an additional <code>InstanceType</code> member. The <code>InstanceType</code> represents the type information carried in the <code>Linker</code> used to typecheck all of the <code>InstancePre</code>'s imports. This is accessible by a new accessor <code>instance_type(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;InstanceType</code>.</li>
<li><code>Instance</code> has a new accessor <code>instance_type(&amp;self, store: impl AsContextMut) -&gt; InstanceType</code>. The store contains all of the information required to construct the InstanceType, so this is just a matter of exposing whats already there.</li>
<li><code>component::types::ComponentFunc</code> has a new method <code>typecheck&lt;Params, Returns&gt;(&amp;self, instance_type: &amp;InstanceType) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;</code>. The underlying typecheck performed here is the exact same one performed in <code>Func::typed&lt;Params, Returns&gt;(&amp;self, store: impl AsContextMut) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;</code>, except rather than the type information coming out of the store, its provided by the InstanceType.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these additions are pub interfaces but marked <code>#[doc(hidden)]</code> to make them "internal", because the prior art was that <code>InstanceType</code> and is internal, and there are no other public interfaces for retrieving <code>InstanceType</code> or typechecking, with the sole exception of <code>Func::typed</code>. I think that we should consider making these documented public interfaces, but I'll leave that to a future PR unless requested.</p>
<h2>Changes to wasmtime-wit-bindgen</h2>
<p>This test case demonstates the extent of the changes: <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10610/files#diff-0b0815115f3addd488fbf1f032466f210b9fcd29ec42f4b4a777e58f80abba16">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10610/files#diff-0b0815115f3addd488fbf1f032466f210b9fcd29ec42f4b4a777e58f80abba16</a></p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>{Foo}Indicies</code> constructor which is used in the <code>InstancePre</code> path <code>new(&amp;Component) -&gt; Result&lt;Self&gt;</code> now has signature <code>new(&amp;Component, &amp;InstanceType) -&gt; Result&lt;Self&gt;</code> .</li>
<li>The other constructor <code>new_instance(impl AsContextMut, &amp;Instance) -&gt; Result&lt;Self&gt;</code> keeps the same signature, because the combination of an Instance and its store are sufficient to create an InstanceType.</li>
<li>The InstanceType is plumbed through to the common <code>_new</code> internals.</li>
<li>Each place an export index is retrieved for a function, <code>.get_export_index</code> has been substituted out with <code>.get_export</code>, and the returned <code>ComponentItem</code> is checked to be a ComponentItem::ComponentFunc(func), and then <code>func.typecheck</code> is invoked with the type argument corresponding to the <code>TypedFunc</code> type parameters.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Future work</h2>
<p>Each export func is typechecked again in its bindgen <code>call_{funcname}</code> function, in which the <code>Func</code> member owned by the typed instance <code>{Foo}</code> struct is cast to a <code>TypedFunc</code> with the specific type parameters bindgen keeps track of for each func. Since the <code>{Foo}</code> struct is created from a <code>{Foo}Indices</code>, we can guarantee that the export funcs have been typechecked against a given <code>Linker</code> or <code>Store</code>, so we could potentially elide the repeated typecheck there, and make an unchecked cast to TypedFunc instead. (TypedFuncs are not stored in the <code>{Foo}</code> struct at least in part because their type parameters may use <code>&amp;'a ...</code> which only apply to the site of the call, and not to the storage of that member in <code>{Foo}</code>. The <code>for&lt;'a&gt;</code> trick only works for trait objects, not concrete types like TypedFunc.)</p>

<p>pchickey edited <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10610">PR #10610</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Based on #10616.</p>
<p>Currently, in bindgen-emitted component wrappers, the existence of export functions is checked at the construction of the {interface-name}Indices struct, but each export function is only finally typechecked on their invocation in {interface-name}::call_{func-name}.</p>
<p>The goal of this PR is to typecheck component exports at the construction of Indices. This is desirable because it gives a type error as early as possible - when using {interface-name}Indices by way of {interface-name}Pre, this can be performed with only an InstancePre, where the creation of an InstancePre requires only a Component and Linker, and typechecks all of the Component's imports. So, really, this is about getting exports on parity with imports.</p>
<p>Closes #9155 . I've worked around this with ugly hacks in embeddings for 2 different employers now and I'm not about to do it for a third.</p>
<h2>Addition to Wasmtime</h2>
<p><code>component::types::ComponentFunc</code> has a new method <code>typecheck&lt;Params, Returns&gt;(&amp;self, instance_type: &amp;InstanceType) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;</code>. The underlying typecheck performed here is the exact same one performed in <code>Func::typed&lt;Params, Returns&gt;(&amp;self, store: impl AsContextMut) -&gt; Result&lt;()&gt;</code>, except rather than the type information coming out of the store, its provided by the InstanceType.</p>
<p>This addition is a pub interfaces but marked <code>#[doc(hidden)]</code> to make them "internal", because the prior art was that <code>InstanceType</code> and is internal, and there are no other public interfaces for retrieving <code>InstanceType</code> or typechecking, with the sole exception of <code>Func::typed</code>. I think that we should consider making these documented public interfaces, but I'll leave that to a future PR unless requested.</p>

<p>The <code>resources-import</code> test case demonstates the extent of the changes: <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10610/files#diff-0b0815115f3addd488fbf1f032466f210b9fcd29ec42f4b4a777e58f80abba16">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10610/files#diff-0b0815115f3addd488fbf1f032466f210b9fcd29ec42f4b4a777e58f80abba16</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Since typechecking information is available from the InstancePre (thanks to #10616), we can unify the two variations on constructing an Indices struct: there is now a single constructor <code>fn new&lt;T&gt;(_instance_pre: InstancePre&lt;T&gt;) -&gt; Result&lt;Self&gt;</code>. Deduplicating this eliminates both generated code and complexity in the generator.</li>
<li>The new sigular constructor uses <code>_instance_pre.component()</code> to lookup exports (both their index and their ComponentItem), and <code>_instance_pre.instance_type()</code> is used to typecheck the export.</li>
<li>Each place an export index is retrieved for a function, <code>.get_export_index</code> has been substituted out with <code>.get_export</code>, and the returned <code>ComponentItem</code> is checked to be a ComponentItem::ComponentFunc(func), and then <code>func.typecheck</code> is invoked with the type argument corresponding to the <code>TypedFunc</code> type parameters.</li>
