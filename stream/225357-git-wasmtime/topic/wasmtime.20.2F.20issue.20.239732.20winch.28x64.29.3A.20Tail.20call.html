<blockquote>
<p>@saulecabrera </p>
<p>Did you have a sketch of a plan on how to implement that already?</p>
<p>I did some homework this weekend, trying to find a path toward tail calls. I think we could do something like described in this post about <a href="https://v8.dev/blog/wasm-tail-call">v8 baseline compiler</a>, or as initially implemented <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6635">in cranelift</a>, basically:</p>
<ul>
<li>set up the frame as if we were about to perform a normal call</li>
<li><code>memcpy</code> the frame down to override the caller frame</li>
<li>jump to the callee entry-point</li>
</ul>
<p>However this is over simplistic. There are many things getting in our way. Here's my understanding of the situation, thus far:</p>
<p>1) The callee and the caller may not require the same amount of stack space for their arguments. In the Winch calling convention, it is the caller that <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/winch/codegen/src/codegen/call.rs#L103-L112">cleans up the stack space for the arguments</a>. This is an issue for tail calls, because the caller doesn't know ahead of time how much stack space will need to be cleaned up when the callee returns. cranelift <code>TailCall</code> convention solves that by requiring that the callee <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/blob/main/accepted/tail-calls.md#new-wasm-calling-conventions-in-cranelift">cleans-up it's stack space</a>. I suppose there are alternatives to let the caller know dynamically the amount of stack space to pop on cleanup, but in any case, it seems to me that we need a calling convention that supports that.<br>
2) The <code>ret_area</code> is inherited from the caller, rather and allocated in the caller stack. This is easy to do: we can get it from the caller's initial control frame. (see <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/winch/codegen/src/visitor.rs#L1899">there</a>). This works, because the callee must have the same return as the caller.<br>
3) We need to emit a jump to the callee, rather than a call, because we must not push a return address, since the state is already set up during the return_call preparation. Winch relies of cranelift to emit relocs for the callee address. The story around converting a function ref to a <code>MachLabel</code> that can be used for a jump is not entirely clear to me yet. Alternatively, we could pop the FP back into it's register and let <code>call</code> push it back (this is what v8 baseline does).<br>
4) Cranelift has <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/2eb65138e9e0f331776d7d3747a47117f706d406/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/x64/inst/emit.rs?plain=1#L1670"><code>Inst::CallReturn*</code></a> macro-instruction, but it's not clear to me if we can use it, since it emits code specific to cranelift <code>Tail</code> calling convention.</p>
<p>I am glancing over a lot of things here, obviously. My principal concern is with <code>1)</code> right now; I don't see a way forward without addressing it.</p>

<p>saulecabrera <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/9732#issuecomment-2647898974">commented</a> on <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/9732">issue #9732</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some preliminary context:</p>
<ul>
<li>Winch has a single, internal calling convention, which is mostly used between Wasm-to-Wasm calls. </li>
<li>Non Wasm-to-Wasm calls (e.g., calls to host-defined functions), go through</li>
<li>
<p>trampolines, which are currently emitted<br>
  through Cranelift. These trampolines convert between different calling conventions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Winch supports other calling conventions (e.g., SysV) used function calls<br>
  which don't go through trampolines (calls to built-in function like<br>
<code>f32.abs</code>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-- </p>
<p>Regarding the implementation of tail-calls:</p>
<p>I don't have a one-size-fits-all answer unfortunately, but we did discuss some<br>
ideas in the past, unfortunately they are not officially documented anywhere; in<br>
the next couple of sentences I'll try to do a summary, taking into account your<br>
points above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I suppose there are alternatives to let the caller know dynamically the amount<br>
of stack space to pop on cleanup, but in any case, it seems to me that we need<br>
a calling convention that supports that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, there have been attempts <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1572400">in other production ready Wasm
compilers</a> to avoid having<br>
the callee clean up the stack space used for arguments. Given that (i) for tail<br>
calls it's assumed that we're using the current frame to resolve calls and (ii)<br>
even though that we don't know the exact space needed for arguments, there are<br>
some expectations around the stack pointer position before/after the call, which<br>
could be helpful to derive the correct stack pointer position in the presence of<br>
tail calls and stack arguments. I was hoping to explore this idea, through<br>
a prototype. The main benefit that I see here is minimizing ABI changes. </p>
<p>The alternative, as you note, is to have the callee clean up any stack space<br>
allocated for stack arguments. Even though, this seems like the obvious<br>
approach, I would not be comfortable introducing this change without a proper<br>
exploration of the other alternatives; a change like this  represents<br>
a fundamental shift in the following fronts:</p>
<ul>
<li>ABI</li>
<li>Frame handling</li>
<li>Multi-value</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case, I don't think we need to introduce a different calling<br>
convention, my expectation is that modifying Winch's default calling convention<br>
should suffice.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The ret_area is inherited from the caller, rather and allocated in the caller<br>
stack. This is easy to do: we can get it from the caller's initial control<br>
frame. (see there). This works, because the callee must have the same return<br>
as the caller.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In principle nothing fundamental should change for multiple return values in<br>
the presence of tail calls. Note that if the callee cleans the space for stack<br>
arguments, some updates will be needed to handle the stack return area.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We need to emit a jump to the callee, rather than a call, because we must not<br>
push a return address, since the state is already set up during the<br>
return_call preparation. Winch relies of cranelift to emit relocs for the<br>
callee address. The story around converting a function ref to a MachLabel that<br>
can be used for a jump is not entirely clear to me yet. Alternatively, we<br>
could pop the FP back into it's register and let call push it back (this is<br>
what v8 baseline does).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many assumptions in this statement, however, if I'm understanding this<br>
statement correctly, I think that relocations and FP/return address handling are<br>
two, largely orthogonal issues that we need to think about regardless.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>In general, I agree that resolving how to handle stack arguments is a<br>
pre-requisite for supporting tail-calls. My expectation is to take an informed<br>
decision based on prototyping, given that there are many trade-offs to consider,<br>
not only around the complexity of the potential ABI changes, but also the<br>
impact of any new changes on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compilation performance</li>
<li>Runtime performance</li>
<li>Other non-x86-64 backends</li>
</ul>
<p>After spending some time thinking a bit more about tail calls, and in<br>
particular, with the last point above (non-x86-64 backends), I'd also recommend<br>
waiting until we can fully run spec tests for aarch64. As I've been working on<br>
trying to get them all passing I've found myself fixing some ABI-related bugs [1]<br>
to ensure that our generated code meets all the aarc64 ABI requirements.<br>
I suspect that if we introduce any new compiler-wide ABI changes, before the<br>
aarch64 backend is fully complete, there's a risk of conflicts down the road,<br>
more concreely around the stack pointer handling and relocations side of things.</p>
