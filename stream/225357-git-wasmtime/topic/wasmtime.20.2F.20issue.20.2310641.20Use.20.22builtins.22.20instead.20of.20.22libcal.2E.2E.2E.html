<blockquote>
<h4>Feature</h4>
<p>Currently Cranelift emits "libcalls" for float-to-int conversion on baseline x86_64.<br>
It is a problem because libcalls require relocation, but relacations are not possible for externally owned code memory.<br>
The idea is to let people to prohibit compiler from emitting libcalls even on baseline x86_64 by using "builtins".</p>
<h4>Benefit</h4>
<p>This feature would allow to freely use <code>wasmtime::CustomCodeMemory</code> without fear of "Unable to apply relocations to readonly MmapVec" error.<br>
It is especially useful for scenarios described in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7777">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/7777</a></p>
<h4>Implementation</h4>
<p>First approach is to completely replace "libcalls" with "builtins".<br>
AFAIK builtins do the same libcalls do, but require no relocations, passes vmcontext and may trap, so I bet they are a bit slower then libcalls.</p>
<p>Builtins are already used for some atomic operations, memory growth, GC and many other things, while libcalls are used only in rare cases for f32/f64 rounding and X86Pshufb (whatever it is).</p>
<p>Note that this approach may brake non-Wasmtime usecases of Cranelift, so maybe alternative approach makes more sense.</p>
<h4>Alternatives</h4>
<p>Alternatively we can add new entry in <code>wasmtime::Config</code> to allow programmers to choose weather builtins or libcalls variants will be used when needed.<br>
This approach is more complicated, but will not add any overhead if replacement is not needed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the CPU you're running code on has various SSE3+ proposals you can also use <code>Config::cranelift_flag_enable</code> to enable those and avoid the use of libcalls. If it doesn't though and you need the libcalls then this change is part of <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9093">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9093</a> where libcalls are avoided entirely in Wasmtime, as you suggest (and also removes the relocation handling path entirely as a result)</p>
