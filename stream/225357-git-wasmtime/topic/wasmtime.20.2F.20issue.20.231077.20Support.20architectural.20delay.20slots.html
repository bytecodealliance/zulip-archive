<blockquote>
<p>Some architectures make use of branch delay slots, such as MIPS and SPARC; some even more exotic ones have load delay slots as well. Often enough there are also instructions with results only usable after certain number of cycles.</p>
<p>I'm trying to port Cranelift to MIPS64. I glanced over the codebase and found no support for filling the delay slots; I had to emit NOPs after every branch in the meantime. (Indeed I didn't expect any because all currently supported architectures have no delay slots.)</p>
<p>So what's the current plan regarding this? A roadmap or implementation guide would be great!</p>
