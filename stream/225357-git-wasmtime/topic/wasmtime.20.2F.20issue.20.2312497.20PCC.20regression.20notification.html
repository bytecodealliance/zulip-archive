<blockquote>
<p>Hi.  This is a tragically unhelpful bug report -- in that I do not have a WASM file I am able to share to reproduce it -- but I have narrowed down the exact version of wasmtime in which the regression occurred.  I am sharing what I know and can communicate purely in hopes that someone finds it useful in connection with some other issue, without any expectation anyone can act on this limited information.</p>
<h3>Test Case</h3>
<p>(unable to provide)</p>
<h3>Steps to Reproduce</h3>
<p>Load a <code>.wasm</code> file as a <code>Component::from_binary</code> with <code>cranelift_pcc(true)</code> in the <code>Engine</code>'s <code>Config</code>.</p>
<h3>Expected Results</h3>
<p>The component loads.</p>
<h3>Actual Results</h3>
<p>Under wasmtime 37.0.2 the Component loads without any issue.<br>
Under wasmtime 38.0.1 the Component load fails with this error:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="Rust"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">Failure</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">loading</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">WASM</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">extracted</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">algorithms</span><span class="p">.:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">Compilation</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">error</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">Proof</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">carrying</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">code</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">validation</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">error</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">UnimplementedInst</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Versions and Environment</h3>
<p>Wasmtime version or commit: 38.0.1</p>
<p>Operating system: Arch Linux</p>
<p>Architecture: x86-64</p>
<h3>Extra Info</h3>
<p>Once again, I'm sorry I cannot provide a <code>.wasm</code> file to reproduce this.  I just wanted to do the courtesy of reporting what I knew, without any expectation of response to it.  My only hope is that this information might be valuable the next time someone looks at the PCC system.  Feel free to close and discard this issue at your pleasure.</p>

<p>Hi @joell -- thanks for the bug report.</p>
<p>It's known that PCC is not currently being tested in CI, so it's likely and in fact even probable that we'll have more cases like this over time, up until the point that we're able to bring it up to date and get it in CI so it stays that way.</p>
<p>This report simply states that there exists <em>some</em> Wasm file for which PCC is incomplete. Since no Wasm file is actually provided, I'll go ahead and close it, as the underlying state is already known. Please do feel free to file another issue (and/or PR to fix!) if you have a concrete example. Thanks!</p>
