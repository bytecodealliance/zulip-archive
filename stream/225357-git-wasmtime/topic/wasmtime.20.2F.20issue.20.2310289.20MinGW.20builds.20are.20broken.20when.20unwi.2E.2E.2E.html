<p>alexcrichton opened <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/10289">issue #10289</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>First discovered in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go/pull/241">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime-go/pull/241</a> which is one of the main users of MinGW builds (AFAIK Go doesn't have MSVC integration). I've bisected through Github Actions (couldn't do so locally) and discovered the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wasmtime is currently built with the github actions <code>windows-2022</code> runner which <a href="https://github.com/actions/runner-images/blob/main/images/windows/Windows2022-Readme.md">uses gcc 12.2.0</a> from MinGW/MSYS2/something.</li>
<li>When these precompiled artifacts are used in wasmtime-go in tests test can fail with exception 0xc0000028 which stands for <code>STATUS_BAD_STACK</code> (aka resurrection of <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/1967">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/1967</a>)</li>
<li>Bisection showed the following properties:<ul>
<li>The faulty PR is <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9929">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9929</a> (which in retrospect isn't too surprising)</li>
<li>If the "faulty PR" is built with <code>windows-2025</code>, which uses gcc 14.2, then the bug does not happen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So it looks like our workaround of <code>-D__USE_MINGW_SETJMP_NON_SEH</code>, used to fix <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9688#issuecomment-2502121814">another bug</a> in <a href="https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9688#issuecomment-2573367719">MinGW gcc</a> is perhaps triggering some other bug in MinGW which is seemingly fixed with more recent GCC versions.</p>
<p>Overall I personally wish we could just drop this target and not worry about it, but I'm unaware of how to integrate with Go on Windows any other way...</p>
