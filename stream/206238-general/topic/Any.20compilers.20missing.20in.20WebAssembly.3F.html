<p>I am currently working on a compiler framework and am trying to figure out what should be my first priority to implement. I think WebAssembly is extremely promising especially with wasmtime, so I would like to build something useful for wasm. Is there any compiler inside webassembly that is currently missing? Maybe a Rust and non LLVM-based C to wasm compiler is needed? Any thoughts here? The compiler project is called xrcf (<a href="https://xrcf.org">https://xrcf.org</a>) by the way, and is largely based on the great design from MLIR but without the C++ drawbacks such as missing goto definition and a hard-to-use build system</p>
