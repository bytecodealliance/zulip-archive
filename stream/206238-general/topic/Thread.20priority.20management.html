<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have been testing wasi-threads with a WAMR runtime and I observed that for the moment no way to create a multi-thread WASM application  that defines different priorities for each thread is provided. <br>
Do you know if there is any proposal to implement the thread priority as part of the WASI-threads API? </p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>wasi-threads was experimental in many ways and avoided some typical concerns like cancellation and priorities. I'd be interested to hear what you need thread priorities for since we're designing the long-term replacement, <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/shared-everything-threads">shared-everything-threads</a>, as we speak. E.g., in a web application one wouldn't have the ability to prioritize web workers... what would one do with your use case there?</p>

<p>Thanks Andrew for your response.<br>
Answering your question, we would like to use WASM modules to be executed by a runtime (e.g., wamr) as a virtualized part of a non-web applications in embedded environments where thread priority management is necessary. Being able to create threads with the required priority in an standardized way for each application would be very useful for non-web environments.</p>
<p>We will have a look at the shared-everything-threads, a very insteresting proposal for us in the mid-term.</p>
