<p>Basically, I want to define a set of services using WASM and the component model. Each service has a state. The host runtime does not need to know what the state contains. Each service is defined using WIT. The WIT file is used to generate the guest code.</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="wit"><pre><span></span><code>// First service.
interface service1 {
    record service1-state {
        last_seen_id: u64,
        last_username: string,
        last_diagnostic_data: list&lt;string&gt;,
    }

    init: func() -&gt; service1-state;
    process: func(service1-state) -&gt; service1-state;
}

// Second service.
interface service2 {
    record service2-state {
        username: string,
    }

    init: func() -&gt; service2-state;
    process: func(service2-state) -&gt; service2-state;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Given that each service processes their old state and transforms it into a new state, can the host run any type of service that adheares to that interface? I.e., take _some_ kind of state as input to the <code>process</code> function and return the new state. Store the state temporarily until the next <code>process</code> execution, pass the stored record to the <code>process</code> function call, repeat. </p>
<p>As far as I can tell, this does not seem to be possible. The host (in my case wasmtime) has to know all states during compile time.</p>

<p>Does encoding the state in a serializable format (Text, JSON, Protobuf, etc) work as a solution to your problem? Adding a function that derives/hydrates a  <code>service-state</code> from an existing serialized format would be the most flexible way (and maybe only way) to achieve your goal presently.</p>

<p>I can encode them. I was hoping that I could avoid that, because the state is rather large and deeply nested, so there would be some overhead.</p>
<p>In my current approach (no C-M),  host writes the state into the WASM module's linear memory and passes the pointer during the <code>process</code> method invocation. </p>
<p>I was thinking about how to convert this to the C-M, since that comes with a lot of (future) benefits like result types, async, resources and more.</p>

<p>My modules and host are written in C/++. Wouldn't a simple memcpy into a buffer be enough for "serialization", as C ABI is stable? My other idea was to rely on a zero-copy de/ser framework. At least that should make it more efficient when compared to JSON et al.</p>

<p>Thanks for the issue link! It does look similar to my "issue". I'll keep an eye on it!</p>

<p>If you know the relevant components and host are C/C++ that could certainly work (and most other languages too, given that C FFI is pretty well used)</p>
<p>Yeah my thought was more on the zero copy side -- thinking of serialization formats that allow for in-memory structures to stay unchanged. I think either approach could work <em>if</em> you can stomach the memcpy!</p>
