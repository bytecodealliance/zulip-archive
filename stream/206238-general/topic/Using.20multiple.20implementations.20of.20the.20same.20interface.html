<p>Hey! </p>
<p>I'm currently developing a tic-tac-toe toy project using a MVC-esque architecture.<br>
The goal would be that the <code>user</code> resource from the <code>user-interface</code> could have 2 implementations, for example 'real-player' and 'bot', which both can be used in the <code>game</code> component.<br>
The goal would be to have a similar system to having 2 different structs in Rust, implement the same trait.<br>
The main issue I'm facing is that in order to instantiate 2 different implementations, these would both have to be composed into the final artifact and thus would have to be differentiated.</p>
<p><a href="/user_uploads/15107/jECI3YXoYInbHh0rnVFgkXya/image.png">sketch of both current and desired setup</a></p>
<div class="message_inline_image"><a href="/user_uploads/15107/jECI3YXoYInbHh0rnVFgkXya/image.png" title="sketch of both current and desired setup"><img data-original-content-type="image/png" data-original-dimensions="2655x1360" src="/user_uploads/thumbnail/15107/jECI3YXoYInbHh0rnVFgkXya/image.png/840x560.webp"></a></div><p>The ideal API for this use-case would be that I want to express that there are multiple implementations available for the same interface, but this goes against the current system.<br>
My current attempts try to create wrappers (worlds and interfaces which's only goal is to re-export the capabilities of the user), which are purely WIT files, but I haven't gotten it to work yet.</p>
<p>What would be the proper approach for tackling this problem?</p>

<p>More-or-less this is unfortunately not supported at this time. You can only export or import one version of an interface, which means that this pattern is not well supported. </p>
<p>You're not the first person to desire this, however, and it's something we'd like to support! I don't believe there's many tracking issues on this but effectively what you want is "nested interfaces" in WIT where you could do something like:</p>
<div class="codehilite" data-code-language="wit"><pre><span></span><code>world my-world {
  interface player1: { nest my:player/interface-definition; }
  interface player2: { nest my:player/interface-definition; }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>(bikeshedding notwithstanding)</p>

<p>I could put effort into reviving this PR if there were renewed interest in it.  I think resolving dependencies from registries would benefit from it.  At the moment though, I kindof figured it would make more sense to revisit after wasi p3 ships</p>

<p>yeah, I don't disagree with the order of things. However, with work on p3 winding down on the spec and tooling side, it might make sense to look into again</p>
