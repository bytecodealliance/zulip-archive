It seems more feasible to offer some guarantees here for Winch than for Cranelift: in Winch the stack is more-or-less 1-to-1 with the Wasm operand stack and locals, plus or minus some alignment concerns, plus a few words for the frame/return address. (I don't remember if callsites push extra or use the args already on the stack -- <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"477345\">@Jeff Charles</span> ?)</p>\n<p>In Cranelift in contrast putting any sort of deterministic requirement on frame size would essentially require regalloc to use the same number of spillslots on every architecture, at every release, and there's no way to say that about the pile of heuristics we have and the different machine instruction shapes and dataflow patterns for each lowering (as I'm sure you're well aware!). One could maybe impose a worst-case cap, and then pad up to that cap so that failures are deterministic, but then there's the classical overprovisioning dilemma (same as with e.g. memory overcommit): one wastes a lot to ensure the average case is the same as the worst case.</p>\n<p>Also, I guess implicit in my thinking above is continuing to count stack usage in bytes, not frames; otherwise one has the problem that the actual stack limit needs to be sized for the worst case.

I am just unsure that I can inject a counter and a check-and-trap code fragment into the guest's sandbox that the guest can't figure out a way to tinker with themselves. but maybe I am just too burned by past experience with clever guests breaking out of their sandboxes.</li>\n<li>I'm not super confident in my ability to write such a pass _at all_, like to identify all the places that need instrumenting and be sure I always emit the instrumentation. somehow it feels more plausible to me to modify the host. but I guess I can make a mistake in either, and it's heartening to hear you say you think it'd be easy.
