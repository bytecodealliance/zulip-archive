Right now (mostly for Rust) we kind of jam the super simple adder example and the more complex stuff into the same tutorial, and it might be worth breaking those out. </p>\n<p>I figure this might be an easier discussion to have (and remember) async:</p>\n<p><span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"570909\">@Ivan Towlson</span>  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"582009\">@Kate Goldenring</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"486181\">@Daniel Macovei</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"938242\">@Tim Chevalier</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"893316\">@Mikhail Katychev</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"689496\">@Eric Gregory</span>  thoughts?</p>",
