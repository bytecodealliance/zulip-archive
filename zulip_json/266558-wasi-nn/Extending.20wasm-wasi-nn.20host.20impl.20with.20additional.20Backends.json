I have recently added the wasmtime-wasi-nn crate for wasi-nn support and so far it has worked out well when using the provided Engines within the crate.</p>\n<p>I now would like to provide my own Engine(s) that are not part of the of the wasm-wasi-nn crate but I have run into a roadblock. When trying to provide the <code>BackendExecutionContext</code> trait impl I cannot access any of the <code>wasmtime_wasi_nn::Tensor</code> properties as they are set private and there is no impl for Tensor to enable accesses.</p>\n<p>Would it be reasonable to add a impl for Tensor allowing access to the Tensor properties ? I see comments that the Tensor struct might be moved to each backend but its not clear how far off this might be.</p>\n<p>Thanks</p>",
