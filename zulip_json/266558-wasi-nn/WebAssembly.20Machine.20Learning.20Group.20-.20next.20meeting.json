The meeting has been on a short pause, but the group has been immensely valuable for discussing wasi-nn topics, weighing use case requirements, getting a sense for timelines for deployment, and in general shaping the wasi-nn specification to the state that it is now, which seems very close to moving to stage 3. Now is the time to regroup, close remaining issues, and move forward, in addition to discussing any other relevant topics here. This email is to confirm a good day and time that we can all meet to reconvene. If you can, please indicate the time that best fits your schedule here: <a href=\"https://calendly.com/d/cn43-bnz-cfm/machine-learning-working-group\">https://calendly.com/d/cn43-bnz-cfm/machine-learning-working-group</a>, so that we may restart this series.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://calendly.com/d/cn43-bnz-cfm/machine-learning-working-group\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/1c6e7f107f7b6df4c38d4d64b1387646e8469464/68747470733a2f2f6173736574732e63616c656e646c792e636f6d2f6173736574732f626f6f6b696e672f6f67696d6167652d343533393537633336373932303065313966636338346530373962356535356366623236616535613361613235303464373562356165646161663337616130632e706e673f736f757263653d6f70656e6772617068&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://calendly.com/d/cn43-bnz-cfm/machine-learning-working-group\" title=\"Machine Learning Working Group - Johnnie Birch\">Machine Learning Working Group - Johnnie Birch</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">We want to build on all the great progress made in 2024 by reviving the machine learning working group meeting which has had a short pause. Please choose an option for an initial day and time to meet.</div></div></div>",

We do expect to continue with the collaboration of this meeting, it's just a question of timing for doing that. Let me ping you directly for some more context.</p>",
