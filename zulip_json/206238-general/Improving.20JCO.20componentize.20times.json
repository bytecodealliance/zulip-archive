Without knowing anything about your project it's hard to say if there's anything that might be uniquely making it slow, but I think that's just the speed of the tooling right now.</p>\n<p>Trying to build the <code>adder</code> example component from Jco takes 13s on my machine, for example. </p>\n<p>ComponentizeJS does work to generate interfaces and splice your script into the StarlingMonkey runtime underneath. </p>\n<p>I don't think componentization speed has been that much of a focus, but we certainly welcome PRs over at <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/ComponentizeJS\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/ComponentizeJS</a> . There might be quite a bit of low hanging fruit, optimization wise!</p>\n<p>What problem are you trying to solve?
