My team likes to have the generated bindings expanded so that changes will be visible in git, and we need to post-process the output a bit (add serde annotations to some generated structs). Doing this with the macro and a <a href=\"http://build.rs\">build.rs</a> script seems to be difficult, but it would be trivial with a shell script that combines a CLI program and sed/awk.</p>",
