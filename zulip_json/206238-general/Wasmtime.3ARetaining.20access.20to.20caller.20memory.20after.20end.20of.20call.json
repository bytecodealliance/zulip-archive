I'm currently writing a WASM interface using Wasmtime wherein the host has a function that will:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>read message bytes from the WASM module's memory</li>\n<li>\n<p>spawn a future that will:<br>\n    a. action the message represented by those bytes<br>\n    b. write some bytes to the WASM module's memory in response<br>\n    c. call a WASM export to notify the module of completion</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>return (before the future has completed)</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>However the problem is that writing to memory requires a context, and we can't use the caller's context as that is only valid for the lifetime of the original host function call. What should I use instead? Thanks.</p>",
