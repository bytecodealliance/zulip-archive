Implementing (2) would allow components to talk GC to each other (or one linear and the other GC, etc) but until (1) was implemented the host-to-component interaction would be limited to linear memory style canon ABI. both (1) and (2) are required in the fullness of time, ofc.</p>\n<p>this is unfortunately not something I have bandwidth to mentor at the moment</p>",
