I suspect that the \"memory control\" proposal wouldn't be detailed enough for the page-by-page support plus the \"address space switching\" that the kernel would expect in a normal MMU configuration, but in theory one could design a followup that would do that. Likewise proper thread suspension/preemption could probably be built as a proposal on top of continuations plus shared-everything threads, somehow (handwave...). It's a fantastically cool technology demo regardless!</p>",
