I have been trying to compile C/C++ and Rust projects from GitHub, but I have only managed to get something like 30 apps. <br>\nAre you aware of some open-source projects or already compiled Wasm modules that might be useful?<br>\nAny help would be great!</p>\n<p>Thank you in advance! <span aria-label=\"grinning face with smiling eyes\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f601\" role=\"img\" title=\"grinning face with smiling eyes\">:grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:</span></p>",
