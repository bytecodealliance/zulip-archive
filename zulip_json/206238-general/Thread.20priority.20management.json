I'd be interested to hear what you need thread priorities for since we're designing the long-term replacement, <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/shared-everything-threads\">shared-everything-threads</a>, as we speak.

Being able to create threads with the required priority in an standardized way for each application would be very useful for non-web environments.</p>\n<p>We will have a look at the shared-everything-threads, a very insteresting proposal for us in the mid-term.</p>",
