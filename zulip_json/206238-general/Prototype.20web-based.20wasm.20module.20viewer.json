I just wanted to share a quick project I worked on that may be of interest to folks here: <a href=\"http://github.com/eqrion/wasm-explorer\">github.com/eqrion/wasm-explorer</a> (<a href=\"https://eqrion.github.io/wasm-explorer\">https://eqrion.github.io/wasm-explorer</a>)</p>\n<p>It's a web based viewer for wasm modules built using componentized versions of the wasm-tools crates (originally a fork of the sandbox from that repo). My hope is to optimize it to work really well for huge wasm modules (+50MiB) where simply opening the text format in an text viewer is not a good experience. It virtualizes the wasm module text format so you navigate through the AST using search, cross references, and a tree view.</p>\n<p>It's pretty early, so there may be bugs. I have a small roadmap of features I hope to add over time, contributions are welcome.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"http://github.com/eqrion/wasm-explorer\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/3b0ef75b0fc71f485edb080046fdf06fa95934b7/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f656135636131643136313031363063383938303133343535326266366335323039386566353264336465313638316464336533336335626234376364353461372f657172696f6e2f7761736d2d6578706c6f726572&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"http://github.com/eqrion/wasm-explorer\" title=\"GitHub - eqrion/wasm-explorer\">GitHub - eqrion/wasm-explorer</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Contribute to eqrion/wasm-explorer development by creating an account on GitHub.</div></div></div>",
