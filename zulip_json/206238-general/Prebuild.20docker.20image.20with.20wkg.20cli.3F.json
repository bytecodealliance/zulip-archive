The project does have the annotations inside it such that <a href=\"https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall\">cargo binstall</a> which itself has binaries distributed as well as a github action. If you are able to contribute whatever to our CI to publish it as a docker image, I'd be happy to review and merge it for you, but I don't know enough about packaging tools like this using docker to do it myself</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/1019826b5c52ef128a0d4f24e6122740044124d0/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f643937396363363935653930366538343862633036613739653836646131626366643866333861343534383263366164613730663963333264323561393933322f636172676f2d62696e732f636172676f2d62696e7374616c6c&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall\" title=\"GitHub - cargo-bins/cargo-binstall: Binary installation for rust projects\">GitHub - cargo-bins/cargo-binstall: Binary installation for rust projects</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Binary installation for rust projects.

I'll poke around a bit with building my own image, and may circle back to make a PR at some point. </p>\n<p>Thank you!</p>",
