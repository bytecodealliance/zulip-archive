It provides hermetic toolchains for the full wasm component workflow: compiling Rust/C/C++/JS to core modules, generating WIT bindings (wit-bindgen), creating components (wasm-tools), composing (wac) etc.  WIT dependencies are resolved automatically from OCI registries via wkg. </p>\n<p>The nice thing about integrating component tooling into a build system like Buck2 is that it understands the full dependency graph -- if you modify just a composition file or a wit interface definition, only the affected downstream targets get rebuilt.</p>\n<p>The repo includes examples:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>validator app that builds and compose components from 3 different languages: rust, c++, js</li>\n<li>a port of great p3 http component-interposition demo from @ejrgilbert</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/andreiltd/wasmono\">https://github.com/andreiltd/wasmono</a></p>",
