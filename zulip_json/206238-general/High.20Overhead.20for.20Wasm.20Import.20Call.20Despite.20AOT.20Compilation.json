Meanwhile, a Wasmtime PR claims this overhead should be closer to <strong>10 ns</strong>: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6262\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/6262</a>. Has anyone seen this level of performance in practice?</p>\n<p>We are <strong>ahead-of-time compiling</strong> the Wasm module and would appreciate any insight into what might cause this kind of discrepancy or how import call overhead is typically minimized when using Wasmtime with <code>__imported_wasi_snapshot_preview1</code>-style imports.
