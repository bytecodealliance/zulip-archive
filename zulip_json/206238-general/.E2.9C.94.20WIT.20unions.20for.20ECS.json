I think making wit-bindgen smarter would lead to more problems than solutions, because it will make some wit more targeted (idiomatic) , instead of rewriting logic for all languages<br>\nSimilar issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/issues/331#issuecomment-2092764465\">https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/issues/331#issuecomment-2092764465</a><br>\nI will probably try making language-specific libs for my use case with help of wit. Maybe remake my use case specific idl<br>\nIf it's possible in zulip, I won't be against reminding me if wit gets new feature for my use case<br>\nThanks for your time.
