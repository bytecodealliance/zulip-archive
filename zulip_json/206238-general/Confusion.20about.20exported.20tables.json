I can try to do it myself.  I already get all the imported functions provided by wasm_bindgen and generate empty implementations for all the functions. My WASM code runs in the wasmtime engine now. But my code includes some async code that uses wasm_bind_futures::spawn_local. Because of the empty implementation, the async task does not work right.<br>\nWhen I dig into it, I find an exported table. This is my blind spot. I need some knowledge to go on.</p>",
