        "content": "<p>Personally I find link previews in Zulip to be annoying in that I rarely want them and a post with a lot of links ends up being very cluttered since at the end of the post is a long wall of previews. In Discord for example you can customize this per-link (e.g. <code>link</code> vs <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>) but I don't think you can do that on Zulip. On Zulip it looks like there's a <a href=\"https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/help/image-video-and-website-previews#configure-whether-website-previews-are-shown\">organization-wide setting</a> for this. I noticed recently that for rust-lang there's no link previews shown, leading me down this path.</p>\n<p>What would others think about disabling link previews? Do others find it useful for example?</p>",
