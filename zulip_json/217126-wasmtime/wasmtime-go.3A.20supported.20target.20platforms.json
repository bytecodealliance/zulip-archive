Precompiled binaries of Wasmtime are checked into this repository on tagged releases so you won't have to install Wasmtime locally, but it means that this project only works on Linux x86_64, macOS x86_64 , and Windows x86_64 currently. Building on other platforms will need to arrange to build Wasmtime and use <code>CGO_*</code> env vars to compile correctly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>However when I look at wasmtime releases I see that wasmtime publishes these targets (and many others, including wasm targets which interest me as well what those mean).</p>\n<p>Is the wasmtime-go README.md just outdated? Or are there still current support issues for the targets I mentioned?</p>",
