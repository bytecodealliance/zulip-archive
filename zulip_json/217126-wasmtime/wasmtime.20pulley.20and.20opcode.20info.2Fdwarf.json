I guess you could pretend that the target arch is actually riscv and then map the pulley registers to riscv registers. Disassembling obviously won't work, you need to do the same remapping in the debuginfo and you will need to force usage of \"hardware\" breakpoints as opposed to software breakpoints (as the latter would try to insert riscv trap instructions at the breakpoint location), but everything else should work I think.</p>",
