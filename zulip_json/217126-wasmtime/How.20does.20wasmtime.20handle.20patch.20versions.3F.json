I am looking for how wasmtime handles linking versions and documentation for how other runtimes are expected to handle non-breaking patch updates. </p>\n<p>I believe the expectation is that runtimes that support older versions of WASI, e.g. <code>0.2.2</code>, should successfully link to a component that has a newer patch version (<code>0.2.3</code>) if the new features are not used. Is that correct?</p>",
