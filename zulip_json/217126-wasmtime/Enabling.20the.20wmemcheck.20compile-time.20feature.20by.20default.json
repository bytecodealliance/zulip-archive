In the test case where this error occurs, <code>REQUEST_HANDLER</code> is at this point definitely initialized, via <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/blob/main/host-apis/wasi-0.2.0/host_api.cpp#L1008\">set_handler</a>, invoked <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/StarlingMonkey/blob/main/builtins/web/fetch/fetch_event.cpp#L618\">here</a>.
