The wording of the explanations in <code>-S help</code> is confusing me.</p>\n<p>Also I'm wondering if there are any more fine-grained options to enable/disable sockets, clocks, ... (everything in <code>-S cli</code> now).</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>",

Options are, in general, free form and cover all sorts of functionality that we need to cover. This includes gated/unstable proposals but it also includes configuration like enabling/disabling the network/etc.</p>\n<p>The <code>-S</code> flag is what Wasmtime supports, but if you'd like more granular or different permissions please feel free to file an issue! Implementation shouldn't be too hard for things like that</p>",
