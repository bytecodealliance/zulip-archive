This work is built directly on top of the existing cooperative threading context-switching work last month. Our current prototype is x86_64-only, since the runtime currently has full support only on x86_64.</p>\n<p>We have an initial implementation exploring two interrupt mechanisms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>epoch interrupt, driven by a ticker thread to trigger context switches with fixed time-elasped, and</li>\n<li>fuel metering, which basically works but currently still has some resources related issues around sync/async interactions that we are still debugging.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This has been a fun project, but we would like to sanity-check the direction with the Wasmtime team and the broader community:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Is there any existing plan to have a proposal or design around preemptive threading?</li>\n<li>If not, would it be preferable for us to draft something and share it for discussion, and if so, should that discussion start on Zulip or GitHub?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This work is primarily exploratory and for fun, but we are also hoping to align on whether a proposal is plausible and, if so, to have a concrete target to guide further implementation.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>",
