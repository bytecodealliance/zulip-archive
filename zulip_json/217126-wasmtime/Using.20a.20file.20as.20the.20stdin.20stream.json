I did find <a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/api/wasmtime_wasi/p2/struct.FileInputStream.html\">FileInputStream</a> but outside crates don't have access to the <code>&amp;File</code> type which is one of the parameters for its public <code>new</code> function (that seems like the <code>new</code> function shouldn't be public or the <code>File</code> type it requires should be public) and <code>FileInputStream</code> doesn't implement <code>StdinStream</code> which is what <code>WasiCtxBuilder</code> needs for the <code>stdin</code> method.</p>",
