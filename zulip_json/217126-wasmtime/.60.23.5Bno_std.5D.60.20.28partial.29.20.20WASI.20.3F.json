What's the best way to keep the wasi parts that are (easily made) <code>no_std</code> compatible and ditch the rest ? Is the <code>wasi</code> feature absolutely required to run files compiles to the <code>wasm32-wasipX</code> targets or can this be done through the component model ? <br>\nMy first idea would be to </p>\n<ul>\n<li>compile your file to <code>wasm32-wasipX</code></li>\n<li>optionally strip the <code>.wasm</code> from the unused wasi symbols</li>\n<li>on the host side, use the <code>component-model</code> feature and create an Host Struct that implements some subset of <code>wasi</code> and stubs the rest</li>\n<li>treat the file as any other component</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Would that work ?</p>",
