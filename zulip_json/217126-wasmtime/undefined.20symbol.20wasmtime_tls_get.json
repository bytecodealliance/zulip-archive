If the wasm module itself is asking for more than 128K of memory, for example if it's initial linear memory is 3+ pages, then there's nothing that can be done from the embedder about that. You'll instead need to build the wasm module differently such that it requires 2 or fewer pages. In the future the custom-page-sizes proposal should help this but that's not integrated into toolchains yet (although I think it will be soon-ish)</p>\n<p>Otherwise you can also explore various configuration options such as <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.memory_reservation_for_growth\"><code>Config::memory_reservation_for_growth</code></a> where the defaults may not be suitable for your embedding (for example you might want to set that to zero)</p>",

We emit object files that are suitable for mmap-ing to virtual memory to assist with copy-on-write initialization. For Pulley we don't know the target platform so we conservatively assume the target page size is 64k (which corresponds to some arm64 platforms) which greatly increases the size of the ELF output file. This naturally doesn't make sense in an embedded context, however, and such padding shouldn't be present at all.  Basically one big optimization here is going to be plumbing the config knob for \"CoW is disabled, don't align things\".</p>\n<p>Otherwise Pulley doesn't modify bytecode, it's possible to read it all from a read-only slice provided im  a rom. The missing piece here is that internally Wasmtime needs to expose an API to read this from an external location rather than trying to copy it around. </p>\n<p>Basically I think the issues you're seeing here should be fixable but will likely require modifications to Wasmtime.

So it's not as bad as I initially thought (in particular because I expect the perf to be around 100x if not more). To give an order of magnitude for numbers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My current interpreter is 25KiB when optimizing for size and 50KiB when optimizing for speed.</li>\n<li>With Wasmtime this becomes 145KiB (70KiB wasmtime, 24KiB pulley_interpreter, 15KiB core, etc) and 250KiB (70KiB wasmtime, 60KiB pulley_interpreter, 50KiB core, 20KiB wasmtime_environ, 10KiB serde, etc) respectively. (core is the additional size only)</li>\n<li>The rest of the firmware is 53KiB (minimal features) to 100KiB (maximal features) when optimizing for size and 95KiB to 180KiB when optimizing for speed, so the current interpreter is 20% to 30% of the firmware. With Wasmtime this would become 60% to 75% at the moment. This seems like a reasonable perf-size trade-off (as long as the size fits).</li>\n<li>Another data point is that devices I consider usually have 1MiB of flash split in 2 banks, which I split further for bootloader, storage, and applets. So the firmware should fit within ~300KiB, which works with Wasmtime when optimizing for size (would be 250KiB).</li>\n</ul>",
