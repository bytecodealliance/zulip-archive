I attempted to make things more robust in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11532\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11532</a> with some more retries it looks like that was just a \"spurious success\" on the PR as it's failing in the queue.</p>\n<p>Once that PR got in the queue I \"jumped\" it to the front. It then failed there. Before it failed I queued a bunch of other stuff in the merge queue. Now that it failed I manually removed it, re-added it, and jumped it again. Now CI is so overwhelmed with hundreds of jobs to run I'm hoping that by the time it actually gets to testing things all the networking issues are gone. Who knows though</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11532\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/e6a7135481a4d8801506f847e21a0173ba1a4c2a/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f663233376131623536333663666633613661363734383766656266333061663863656664316239643761653530386366386331386132346235333366336463632f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d652f70756c6c2f3131353332&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11532\" title=\"Try to make CI more robust with more retries by alexcrichton 路 Pull Request #11532 路 bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">Try to make CI more robust with more retries by alexcrichton 路 Pull Request #11532 路 bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Try adding --retry to a bunch of curl commands to see if we can make CI a bit more robust in the face of flaky network failures.</div></div></div>",
