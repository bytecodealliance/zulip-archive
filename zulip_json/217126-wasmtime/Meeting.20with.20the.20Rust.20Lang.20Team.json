        "content": "<p>I can make the date as well, and in the meantime I'm going to drop some loose notes here about what we can talk about. I'm a bit intimidated to take up 90m of the lang team's time just for us in the sense that I'm not sure our feedback is worth so much time, but I figure we can collect things first to better gauge if it'll be worth it. The things that I can think of are:</p>\n<h2><code>become</code></h2>\n<p>On the top of my head because I just saw it, but our Pulley interpreter in \"tail loop\" mode requires the <code>become</code> keyword. Right now we have a <code>#[cfg]</code> to switch between a \"match loop\" and a \"tail loop\" but it'd be nice to commit to just one. This isn't entirely on Rust though, we have what we need to evaluate <code>become</code> and we mostly just haven't put in all the legwork to say with confidence \"yep this is what we want\"</p>\n<h2>Non-overwritable <code>&amp;mut T</code></h2>\n<p>We have a problem where host functions get <code>&amp;mut Store&lt;T&gt;</code> more-or-less, but the problem is that it's not sound to do something like <code>*the_store = Store::new(some_ctor())</code>. To work around this we have our own type <code>StoreContextMut&lt;'_, T&gt;</code> which internally holds <code>&amp;mut Store&lt;T&gt;</code>. This has decent enough ergonomics for external users given enough trait impls, but it has pretty awful ergonomics internally within Wasmtime. It'd be much nicer to \"just use <code>&amp;mut Thing</code>\".</p>\n<h2>Read-only fields (unsafe fields?)</h2>\n<p>We're (ab)using <code>Pin</code> right now to make it unsafe to get a <code>&amp;mut vm::Instance</code> right now. It's not really about self-referential types at all, we just want to make it unsafe to get a <code>&amp;mut vm::Instance</code> because it's not safe to mutate some fields. This works well-enough but it's a roundabout solution for what we want which is to disallow mutation of a field after creation (or overwriting it?). Or maybe require unsafe access to a field which would disallow overwriting the whole structure? Unsure.</p>\n<h2>Pin ergonomics</h2>\n<p>Given above we're using <code>Pin</code> internally but the ergonomics are not great:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lots of <code>self.as_mut().thing(...)</code></li>\n<li><code>mut self: Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;</code> is a mouthful</li>\n<li>pin-projection requires <code>unsafe</code> or integration of foreign crates, just a bit awkward</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(I don't think any of this is news to the lang team)</p>\n<h2>Non-leakable types</h2>\n<p>For Rust-compiled-to-wasm the component model has async support now which is, if you squint enough, io-uring like in that you give a region of memory to the host and it fills it in later. Rust's \"any type is safe to leak\" forces safe bindings to always pass everything by ownership which is a bit of a bummer. Not that adding non-leak types is easy of course, but if we're listing out everything may as well list it out.</p>\n<h2><code>where F: AsyncFn(), F(..): Send</code></h2>\n<p>We more-or-less can't use <code>AsyncFn*</code> anywhere unless we can bound the return type. A well-known issue but we can add fuel to the fire maybe.</p>\n<h2><code>fn(T)</code> is not <code>'static</code> unless <code>T: 'static</code></h2>\n<p>Feels weird to us (shouldn't require <code>T: 'static</code>), but we don't know if it's intentional or not. Would be nice if it weren't the case, but it's also not the end of the world to us.</p>\n<h2>dyn-compatible <code>async fn</code></h2>\n<p>We've got a number of usages of <code>#[async_trait]</code> specifically for <code>dyn</code>-compatibility. Again not an easy ask by any means but like above maybe we can add fuel to the fire.</p>\n<h2>Esoteric reasons we still have C code in Wasmtime/wit-bindgen</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>AFAIK it's impossible to call <code>setjmp</code> in Rust safely</li>\n<li>Need to be able to define a symbol as \"weak\" (the defining half of weak linkage)</li>\n<li>Need to be able to optionally import a symbol (the declaring half of weak linkage) -- this is used much more rarely but still used in Wasmtime.</li>\n<li>Need to define \"dllexport\" symbols on Windows (we have a comment saying <code>#[export_name]</code> isn't sufficient)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Calling a <code>&amp;mut self</code> method with access to a subset of fields</h2>\n<p>We've got a giant <code>Store&lt;T&gt;</code> type which is passed everywhere internally within Wasmtime. More and more methods need simultaneous borrows to multiple fields in this type, but in an effort to keep the implementation details private we keep adding more and more methods for various permutations of fields. It'd be nice if we could call \"base methods\" where each method accesses a disjoint set of fields. Like many above this is a well-known problem in Rust I believe.</p>\n<h2>Wasm proc macros</h2>\n<p>Rustc should have more wasm in it <span aria-label=\"smiling face with horns\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f608\" role=\"img\" title=\"smiling face with horns\">:smiling_face_with_horns:</span></p>\n<p>(this is a joke, not a serious ask)</p>",

We currently have a bunch of dynamic \"is same engine\" and \"is same store\" checks, out of necessity, because our index-based handles could otherwise lead to incorrectness. We would need \"generative\" or \"path-dependent\" or \"place-based\" types/lifetimes to statically encode, in the types, that e.g. an <code>Instance</code> is associated with a particular engine, and ensure only values from the same engine interact; Rust's type system today mostly can't do this. (Gankra's masters thesis contains a neat closure-trick that is technically generative within the scope of a closure, but would be completely unergonomic in our APIs.) I know the Rust community generally is thinking about this; and Niko has a <a href=\"https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2024/06/02/the-borrow-checker-within/\">blog post</a> that mentions \"place-based lifetimes\" that is a step in the direction.

For all these cases, the usual approach would be to compile for <code>x86_64-unknown-none</code>, which is a <code>no_std</code> target. That's all well and good except that that target has an ABI that assumes <em>softfloat</em>: vector registers are not available at all and all FP values go through software implementations of operators. Usually in these environments we've done the legwork to be able to actually use the ordinary hardware float ABI.</p>\n<p>So it's a pretty simple mechanical plumbing thing, but basically we end up needing is a custom target.</p>\n<p>Where this gets weird/interesting is that custom targets are nightly-only, so our current plan is just to require a nightly compiler, but that sucks, especially in a corporate environment where new things are already seen as suspicious and unstable.</p>\n<p>The concrete ask for rustlang as a whole would be to stabilize <code>-Zbuild-std</code> so custom targets can work at the same level as built-in targets for <code>no_std</code> code that uses <code>core</code>/<code>alloc</code>. That may or may not be a lang-team thing but I guess Pat brought it up because it's a real impediment for adoption</p>",
