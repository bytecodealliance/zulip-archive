One thing that'd be awesome to see if someone's interested to work on this would be to add a mode where you can compile some Rust source code to wasm, then feed that wasm into Wasmtime, then see the disassembly of Wasmtime's compiled object file. This can't be done today as far as I know and I'm not sure how difficult it would be, but if there's any interested godbolt hackers reading this my hope is to snipe one of you into doing this :)</p>\n<p>(not urgent by any means of course, but figured I'd drop this somewhere!)</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"http://godbolt.org\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/4bf336f7597f851df0732b12f8d4b7b383508ec8/68747470733a2f2f6769746875622e636f6d2f636f6d70696c65722d6578706c6f7265722f696e6672612f626c6f622f6d61696e2f6c6f676f2f66617669636f6e2e706e673f7261773d74727565&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"http://godbolt.org\" title=\"Compiler Explorer\">Compiler Explorer</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Compiler Explorer is an interactive online compiler which shows the assembly output of compiled C++, Rust, Go (and many more) code.</div></div></div>",
