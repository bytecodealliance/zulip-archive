This works on a small example where I only had to implement <code>wasmtime_tls_{get,set}</code> from the <code>capi.rs</code>. But on a bigger example I'm missing more symbols like <code>wasmtime_mmap_remap</code> etc.</p>\n<p>I'm wondering if there's a way to avoid doing that, for example by lying about the presence of virtual memory (i.e. <code>cfg(has_virtual_memory)</code> would return false). Or if I have to implement the <code>capi.rs</code> completely (like in the <code>min-platform</code> example).</p>",
