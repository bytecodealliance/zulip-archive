I know from this issue <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11685\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11685</a> that a precompiled binary should be fine between major versions.</p>\n<p>i searched <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/?search=version\">https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/?search=version</a> but i dont see how i can access the current version for my cache key. </p>\n<p>i can use a build script and extract it from my Cargo.toml. </p>\n<p>a wasmtime::version() would be nice to have. unless there is another way to get this value?</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11685\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/cef09f4332c0c8a44233be978099699eb78ef167/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f333462316266306266613030333430633964626536633663646432383834383134646237343932663032303234653337323963623137373661333037356364352f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d652f6973737565732f3131363835&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11685\" title=\"LTS version of wasmtime does not allow loading cwasm from earlier LTS patch version 路 Issue #11685 路 bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">LTS version of wasmtime does not allow loading cwasm from earlier LTS patch version 路 Issue #11685 路 bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">We are embedding wasmtime in hyperlight-wasm.
