The <code>-O</code> flags are optimization/tuning flags and <code>memory-reservation</code> has <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime/latest/wasmtime/struct.Config.html#method.memory_reservation\">a big impact on perf</a>. That being said for platforms which don't support Cranelift (e.g. risc-v as you're using here) it's ok to set <code>memory_reservation</code> to zero (or something smaller as you are doing already)</p>\n<p>This is a situation where the default settings for the host differ from the default settings of the target, so that's why the <code>-Omemory-reservation=...</code> flag is required when compiling the module</p>",
