The surface experience or overall goals don't change at all -- this is about compiler and runtime-level implementation strategy, but certain details were fixed in the original RFC so we need a new one to update them. Interested to hear your feedback!</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/44\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/baa3bf319b439bb9581f9148b5917439e904714e/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f613461653666316465323634366265623438323365633164653963613064653934666235323738373362623436633066353764313332316462663136326164392f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f726663732f70756c6c2f3434&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/44\" title=\"RFC: new approach to debugging in Wasmtime by cfallin 路 Pull Request #44 路 bytecodealliance/rfcs\">RFC: new approach to debugging in Wasmtime by cfallin 路 Pull Request #44 路 bytecodealliance/rfcs</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">This RFC describes updates to our plan-of-record for debugging in Wasmtime, as I plan to start work soon.
