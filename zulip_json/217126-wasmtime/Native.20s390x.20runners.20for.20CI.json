Looks like to take advantage of that a GitHub admin for the BA org will need to install an app. It also looks like part of that is also registering an \"IBMid\" with the same email address as whomever installs the app. Could I solicit a GitHub admin's assistance for this? Not urgent of course!</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/IBM/actionspz/issues/19#issuecomment-3304755539\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/0e4404947aafdadc3763afd81f638e06205bec3a/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f633731356361656166323839613661636162386436326330363535643633653335346335326539646636376432396431363136303039643565396237303833362f49424d2f616374696f6e73707a2f6973737565732f3139&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/IBM/actionspz/issues/19#issuecomment-3304755539\" title=\"New Project: Wasmtime · Issue #19 · IBM/actionspz\">New Project: Wasmtime · Issue #19 · IBM/actionspz</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Please describe the project Wasmtime is a lightweight WebAssembly runtime that is fast, secure, and standards-compliant.

I don't know if that makes this entirely a nonstarter, or just pushes it to main-branch-only jobs, but it's something to note as it diverges from our current PR workflow</p>",

It's not entirely a non-starter since most s390x CI goes through the merge queue which should count as \"from the repo\", so the only thing we need to worry about is the PR CI.
