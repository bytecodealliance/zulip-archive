PR <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11442\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11442</a> (from <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"253994\">@Alex Crichton</span>  back in august) changed <code>ResourceLimiter</code> to have a <code>Send</code> bound and this is somewhat problematic for my embedding. I don't entirely understand why it's necessary or even (I'm embarrassed to say) how Send and async fit together. or if they do at all. I guess it has to do with multi-threaded executors? I am only using and only wanting to use wasmtime (or at least the resources associated with a single Store) on a single thread at a time. is there any way I can eliminate the Send bound in that case, or conditionalize it? </p>\n<p>(I suppose there is also the option of just declaring my ResourceLimiter type as Send, unsafely, knowing that it won't ever move between threads; but I feel a little bad doing that)</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11442\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/e36cfa3ad62234d907479fb02fd232db81c4cff7/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f666161633334383866356530383961306265373661393265323535373235323032333235313066363033326334373436386136646632343966613733376364372f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7761736d74696d652f70756c6c2f3131343432&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11442\" title=\"Make table growth a true `async fn` by alexcrichton 路 Pull Request #11442 路 bytecodealliance/wasmtime\">Make table growth a true `async fn` by alexcrichton 路 Pull Request #11442 路 bytecodealliance/wasmtime</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Upon further refactoring and thinking about #11430 I&#39;ve realized that we might be able to sidestep T: Send on the store entirely which would be quite the boon if it can be pulled off.
