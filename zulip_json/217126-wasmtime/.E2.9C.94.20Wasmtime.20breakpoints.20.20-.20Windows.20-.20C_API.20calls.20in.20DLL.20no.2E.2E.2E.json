You can NOT tell someone they're \"getting annoying\" and \"stay out of my threads\" as a reply to a polite request to change behaviors that are disruptive to others in this space. And whether you see them as such or not, your ways of engaging <em>are</em> disruptive: there is no such thing as \"your threads, and messages in streams that people have subscribed to will notify them.</p>",
