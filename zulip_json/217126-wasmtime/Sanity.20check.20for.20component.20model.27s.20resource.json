Also, it might not be an error for leaking resources on wasmtime as they would get cleaned up eventually, but it might be an error on RPC based systems, so it could also be helpful too. But I'm not quite sure if this can be achieved. For example, the <code>OutgoingBody</code> uses a <code>finish</code> to close, but it's not something declared in the standard reflected by type or something. </p>\n<p>Any thoughs?</p>",

The idea was that there are at least two levels of testing for a conformance suite:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>blackbox component testing (does the runtime get the right answer?)</li>\n<li>whitebox runtime testing (does the runtime do what the spec/a reasonable embedder expects? does it enter states and emit things that are expected?)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Obviously you don't want to be too restrictive on what runtimes can do, and the most important is the component testing, but I (for one) think it's definitely a good idea to have these.</p>\n<p>Would love to have others weigh in here</p>",
