I think it'd be worth reexporting that type from the wasmtime crate for convenience too. </p>\n<p>For the actual method one option might be to just expose a &amp;mut WasmFeatures accessor as opposed to a pure getter setter since bitflags have a lot of convenient methods too. Exposing wasm_feature too though also I think would be fine</p>",
