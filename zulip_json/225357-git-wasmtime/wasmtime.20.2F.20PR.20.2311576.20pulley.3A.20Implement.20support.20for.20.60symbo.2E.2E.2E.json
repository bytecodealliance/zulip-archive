Additionally handling of relocations on Pulley is improved to be more \"formal\" as opposed to just blindly using an x64 relocation and assuming it works out. The intention here is to make Pulley behave more similarly to other platforms in all these respects while also enabling usage of Wasmtime to eventually use <code>symbol_addr</code> to calculate an address relative to the current PC (similar to x64).</p>\n<p>This includes Cranelift golden tests as well as more filetests being run, but the actual integration into Wasmtime will be deferred to a future commit.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
