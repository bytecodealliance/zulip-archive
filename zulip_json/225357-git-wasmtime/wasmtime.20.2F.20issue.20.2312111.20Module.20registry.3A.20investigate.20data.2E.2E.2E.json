This leads to a small but consistent observed increase in instantiation time (~3% or 40ns in tests with a store of one small module).</p>\n<p>In theory we could avoid the cost of materializing a separate <code>StoreCode</code> by making <code>ModuleWithCode</code> carry a view on <em>some</em> text/range, and building it to use <code>EngineCode</code>'s text slice directly in the non-debug case. The commit <a href=\"https://github.com/cfallin/wasmtime/commit/73b0bbe8d5101e5849a22404f2809895f0ee7495\">here</a> did enough of this to avoid a lookup in the engine-to-store-code map on the funcref init path, but we could carry it a bit further and avoid creating a <code>StoreCode</code> at all at instantiation.</p>\n<p>There may be other optimizations we could do as well, after profiling.</p>\n</blockquote>",
