With the APIs available today on the <code>Store</code>, there is no way to invalidate the frame cursor while within its lifetime-bounded scope (with lifetime tied to the <code>Store</code> that is passed into the hostcall creating the cursor), so the API today should be completely safe. This PR makes it so.</p>\n<p>[this discussion]: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/12176#discussion_r2636431864\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/12176#discussion_r2636431864</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
