In the process, I noticed and fixed a couple of related issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I had forgotten to implement or test host reader support in <code>DirectSource</code> :facepalm:</li>\n<li>The code to support host-to-host pipes failed to account for partial reads</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've also simplified the <code>StreamConsumer</code> and <code>StreamProducer</code> APIs slightly by having them take their <code>Source</code> and <code>Destination</code> parameters by value rather than by reference, respectively.</p>\n<p>Note that, per <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/issues/561\">https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/issues/561</a>, I've tweaked the documentation for <code>StreamProducer</code> to indicate that implementations might reasonably opt to \"pretend\" they're ready without buffering any items when handling zero-length reads given that buffering has its own hazards.  Likewise, I've updated the <code>wasi-filesystem</code> and <code>wasi-cli</code> implementations to \"pretend\" instead of buffering.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
