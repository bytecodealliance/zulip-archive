Reusing the result doesn't actually yield better code (equivalently good or worse depending on if null/i31 are allowed or not) and is somewhat subtle -- I have to stop and re-think through its correctness each time I see it again -- so this change should be a welcome improvement.</p>\n<p>This does not change the logic of the emitted code, but does slightly change the emitted code itself.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
