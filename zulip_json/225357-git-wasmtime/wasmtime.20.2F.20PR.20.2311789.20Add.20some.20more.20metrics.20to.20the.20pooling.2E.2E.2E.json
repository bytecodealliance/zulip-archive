Notably the count of unused memory and table slots is exposed along with the number of bytes which are kept resident in these slots despite them not being in use. This involved a bit of plumbing to thread around the number of bytes that are actually kept resident to some more locations but is otherwise a pretty straightforward plumbing of accounting information we already had internally.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
