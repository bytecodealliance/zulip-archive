This is in contrast to core wasm testing where all instances get placed in the same store. The reason for this is that components, in particular async state, is only fully defined so long as a trap doesn't happen and once a trap happens it's expected the entire store is torn down. This removes the need for the store to keep track of exactly which instance all async tasks are associated with to ensure that once any of them trap only the precise set of tasks necessary are torn down. Instead Wasmtime can rely on embedders throwing away <code>Store&lt;T&gt;</code> entirely.</p>\n<p>The refactoring here provides a hook in <code>WastContext</code> to configure the store but otherwise a new store is manufactured for all component instances. Core wasm is unaffected. Tests are also unaffected as same-store behavior isn't actually required by any tests.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
