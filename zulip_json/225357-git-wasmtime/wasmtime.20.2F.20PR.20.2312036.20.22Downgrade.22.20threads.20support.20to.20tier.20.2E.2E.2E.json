The fuzz bug specifically has to do with fallout from #12022, specifically <code>SharedMemory</code> being used to allocated instead of <code>Memory</code>. In this situation the resource limiter is no longer consulted meaning that shared memories bypass this and aren't caught by OOM checks. This is currently by design because <code>SharedMemory</code> instances don't know which resource limiter to hook into per-store.</p>\n<p>More generally though the implementation of wasm threads, while workable in Wasmtime, has a number of known relatively large deficiencies. These were not resolved prior to ungating the wasm proposal (that's on me) but nevertheless the quality of implementation is not quite up to \"tier 1 par\" with the rest of what Wasmtime offers. Given that I'm proposing that threads is downgraded to tier 2 for now which means, primarily, that we won't issue CVEs for issues with it. The proposal is still on-by-default and usable-by-default, but my hope is to reflect the current level of quality in Wasmtime with this adjustment.</p>\n<p>This commit shuffles around some documentation of wasm proposals to split it into tier 1/2/3 instead of on/off-by-default and then adds a column for whether the proposal is on-by-default.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
