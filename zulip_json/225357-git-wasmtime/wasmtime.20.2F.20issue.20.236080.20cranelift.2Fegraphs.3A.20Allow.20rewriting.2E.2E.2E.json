This would mean that we don't need to actually deal with code that becomes unreachable or do anything to fix up uses of values that are no longer defined because they are still defined (even tho the uses will never be reachable).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>However, in an ideal world, we would eagerly terminate the block with <code>trap</code> and then rather than fixing up uses of values that are no longer defined, we would completely avoid traversing those uses' now-unreachable blocks in the rest of the egraph pass.</p>\n<p>In the PR linked above, Chris said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The branch-folding cases are a bit harder; ideally we do actually skip traversing the newly-unreachable blocks, perhaps by tombstoning them with a flag set by the branch simplification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think that we want the inverse of tombstones: reachable bits. Otherwise we cannot differentiate between a block with multiple predecessors, one of which got optimized away but others that did not, versus a block with a single predecessor that got optimized away and now it is unreachable. This should be possible by making the egraph pass use a computed-on-demand pre-order traversal, rather than a pre-computed dominator tree's pre-order traversal (which will not reflect any changes to the CFG that optimizations create).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",

I think it's sufficient to use the same traversal order computed up front, but when you get to a block you can skip it if by that time it has not been found to be reachable. I think the necessary condition for that to work is that CFG edges are only deleted, not added, which I think is largely a reasonable restriction. Although it might also be okay to move an edge to point to a different block as long as it was dominated by the original target of that edge, or something like that?</p>\n<p>That said I'm confused about your mention of pre-order traversal because I don't remember now what the requirements on traversal order are and why we didn't use reverse post-order, so maybe that's where my reasoning falls down, I don't know.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I agree with Jamey that removing edges should be (I think?) possible to handle by skipping blocks during the traversal, and nothing else about dominance or use-def links needs to change, as long as we don't visit unreachable code. Put another way, removing edges can never cause an existing dominance relation to go from <code>true</code> to <code>false</code> for reachable code: if <code>A dom B</code> before removing an edge, that means the only paths from start to <code>B</code> were through <code>A</code>, and removing an edge cannot create a new path not through <code>A</code>, so <code>A dom B</code> still if there are any paths to <code>B</code>.</p>\n<p>That said, good call @fitzgen on reachability vs not-reachability; I hadn't thought about the removing-only-one-in-edge case!  So I think it could be something like: <code>block_reachable_in_edges: SecondaryMap&lt;Block, u32&gt;</code>, starts at zero, increments when we process a terminator and see targets; at each block visit during the first (egraph-building) traversal, skip a block if the count is zero.</p>\n<p>Note also this might combine nicely with blockparam removal, per Jamey's and others' thoughts, but that's a whole other topic :-)</p>\n</blockquote>",
