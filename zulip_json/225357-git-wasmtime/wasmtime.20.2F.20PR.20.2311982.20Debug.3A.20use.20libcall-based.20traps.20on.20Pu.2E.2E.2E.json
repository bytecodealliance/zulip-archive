It updates the Wasm lowering to Pulley to fully support libcall-based traps, as this will be the only supported method of handling traps when debugging Wasm with our guest-debugging functionality.</p>\n<p>Previously, compilation targeting Pulley was special-cased to continue to use \"trapping\" Pulley instructions even when signal-based traps were turned off, because the Pulley interpreter handles these \"traps\" in (host) software, so we still didn't require OS-level signal interception. But this is not good enough for debugging support because we need the actual libcall to enter the runtime and pass ownership of the store so that a debugger hook, if any, can run. Thus, we modify the predicate on the <code>FuncEnvironment</code> that, conveniently, is the central decision point for whether to use trapping instructions.</p>\n<p>Doing this then hits an unimplemented opcode in Pulley: <code>uadd_overflow</code>, without the <code>_trap</code> part, returning a second result indicating whether an overflow occurred. This PR implements that opcode in the straightforward way with a compare of the sum against one of the summands (as also done by e.g. aarch64).</p>\n<p>With this, Pulley debugging is again at parity with native.</p>\n</blockquote>",
