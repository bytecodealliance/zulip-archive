The problem with generating it in <code>cranelift-assembler-x64</code> is that that setup requires <code>cranelift-codegen</code> to have access to the <code>OUT_DIR</code> used by <code>cranelift-assembler-x64</code> which is prevented when building under Bazel which tries to isolate the builds of separate crates.</p>\n<p>This change instead adds a function to <code>cranelift-assembler-x64</code> which returns the expected contents of <code>assembler-definitions.isle</code> so that the build step of <code>cranelift-codegen</code> can write it to an accessible directory.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

In thinking about generating the ISLE definitions, I realized recently that they are quite <code>cranelift-codegen</code>-specific. I think that, if we move the ISLE generation out of the <code>cranelift-assembler-x64-meta</code> crate and directly into the <code>cranelift-codegen-meta</code> crate, we not only fix this <code>OUT_DIR</code> issue that affects Bazel builds but it's better code organization. All ISLE compilation/generation lives in <code>cranelift-codegen-meta</code> already, so why not move the assembler part of that to the same place? I recognize that may be a larger refactor than this PR and I'm willing to do it since I'm most familiar with all of this. Thoughts?</p>\n</blockquote>",
