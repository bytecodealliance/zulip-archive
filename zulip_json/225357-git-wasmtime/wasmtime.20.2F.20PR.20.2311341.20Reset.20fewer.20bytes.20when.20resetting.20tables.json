Previously the full capacity of the table was reset back to zero, depending on the configuration of the pooling allocator. Now the table's dynamic size is taken into account as the size of the allocation to reset. This should help resetting fewer bytes and making <code>keep_resident</code> options more applicable for example because tiny tables, as can show up in components, don't need a large memset followed by a decommit and can instead just use a tiny memset.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
