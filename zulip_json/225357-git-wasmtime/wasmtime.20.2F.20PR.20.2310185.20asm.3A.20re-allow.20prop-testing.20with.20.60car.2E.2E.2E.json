This latter use case could replace the tedious emit tests we had to write in <code>cranelift-codegen</code> _and_ find corner cases that we otherwise might not explore. It helped me during development: just run <code>cargo test</code> to check if anything is obviously wrong. <code>arbtest</code> seemed to be able to run ~1000 test cases and found mistakes well within the one second time limit I gave it.</p>\n<p>@alexcrichton improved #10110 by avoiding <code>Arbitrary</code> implementations everywhere and unconditionally depending on the <code>arbitrary</code> crate. This was the right change, but it removed the ability to property test using <code>cargo test</code>. What this change does is retain the general intent of his change (no extra dependencies) but add <code>Arbitrary</code> implementations for <code>cfg(test)</code> as well to run property tests during <code>cargo test</code>.</p>\n<p>The only downside I see here is the added complexity when conditionally compiling the fuzz-related bits: <code>#[cfg(any(test, feature = \"fuzz\"))]</code>. Perhaps there is a better way to do this, but this seemed to work fine. Let me know what you think.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
