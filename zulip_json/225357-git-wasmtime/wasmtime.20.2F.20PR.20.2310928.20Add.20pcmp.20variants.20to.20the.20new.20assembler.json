I looked into this and talked with @abrown and it looks like we don't have information at the time of display that would alert us to tweak the output here to read <code>const(0)</code> or anything else we choose. Perhaps we could figure out how to propagate that along but I am assuming the benefit would just be for highlighting a relocation reference during some stage of debugging. Do you think that is needed as a future todo? In any case for me, now that you've explained, it seems that task is unrelated to the correctness of pcmp* here, but are you also comfortable that I've bless the filetest solution update here in this pr?</p>\n</blockquote>",

I do suspect one could do something with traits here -- we already need to carry the amode with relocations somewhere, so perhaps we could have a \"pretty-print\" hook that Cranelift plugs into the assembler. No need to do that in this PR though, I don't think.</p>\n</blockquote>",
