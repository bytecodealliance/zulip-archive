Investigation revealed that the load of the bound itself was GVN'd and deduplicated (yay!) but it meant that the load was used in two locations meaning it didn't pass checks for <code>sinkable_load</code>. This commit fixes this by repurposing <code>xbc32_bound_trap</code> for \"the bound is in a register\" and renaming the previous instruction to <code>xbc32_boundne_trap</code>. This helps cut down on the number of opcodes in this benchmark and improves performance slightly.</p>\n<p>At the same time this tightens up \"sinkable loads\" to require native endianness since that's what the bound of memory is stored as. Additionally in addition to testing for <code>a &lt; b</code> and optimizing that this also now optimizes <code>b &gt; a</code>, the same condition just having the arguments swapped.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
