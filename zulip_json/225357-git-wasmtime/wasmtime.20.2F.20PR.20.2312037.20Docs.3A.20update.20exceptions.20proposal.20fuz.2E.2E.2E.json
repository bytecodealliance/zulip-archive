I don't think that the type is plumbed in the API yet nor the ability to create/manage the references. I think all the pieces are there, however, and it's mostly just a matter of copying the anyref constructors/inspectors/etc for <code>exnref</code> as well.</p>\n<p>For fuzzing I could go sort of either way myself. On one hand the preexisting wasm-smith-based fuzzing is good in that it creates interesting shapes of code. In that sense I feel like it fuzzes the compiler side of exceptions relatively well. On the other hand though, like with most other wasm-smith-based-fuzzing, I feel like it's probably leaving quite a lot on the table in terms of runtime-handling fuzzing. For example I suspect everything either immediately throws-and-doesn't-catch or never throws because intersting payloads are never on the stack (or something like that). In that sense I do think there's very real space for a more interesting fuzzer exceptions-wise, primarily focused on the runtime behavior of exceptions as opposed to the compile-time-behavior. I don't have a concrete idea though what such a fuzzer would precisely be fuzzing, and whether we block on that for enabling exceptions, I'm not sure. Perhaps a good meeting topic as well?</p>\n<p>At the very least though adding a <span aria-label=\"construction\" class=\"emoji emoji-1f3d7\" role=\"img\" title=\"construction\">:construction:</span> symbol plus a footnote explaining the current situation is definitely ok though. </p>\n</blockquote>",
