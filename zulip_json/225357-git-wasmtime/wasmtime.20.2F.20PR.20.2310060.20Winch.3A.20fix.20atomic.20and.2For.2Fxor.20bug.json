The issue was that I was using the operand as a destination for the <code>AtomicRmwSeq</code>, but it is a macro-instruction, and the operand ended up being overwritten. This was caught when I enabled the <code>atomic.wast</code> spec tests in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10039#issuecomment-2603318507\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10039#issuecomment-2603318507</a>.</p>\n<p>Investigating into the issue I realized that <code>AtomicRmwSeq</code> also had requirement for one of it's registers, but that didn't show up initially, because I got lucky, and the value was popped in the right register every time I tested.</p>\n<p>The fix is to pop-push the operand to compute the address, and then pass the codegen context to masm to allocate the registers.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
