Having this here is certainly better than constructing all the necessary structs when trying to reason about some code sequence, but it still feels a bit much. This is not really anything that needs to be solved in this PR; in fact, it might be better solved once most instructions have been ported to the new assembler. But I bring it up to see if anyone has any good ideas for reducing this kind of thing.</p>\n</blockquote>",
