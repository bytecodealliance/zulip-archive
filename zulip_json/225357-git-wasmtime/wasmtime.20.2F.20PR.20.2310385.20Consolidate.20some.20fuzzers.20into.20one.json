This follows the pattern of [wasm-tools's <code>run</code> fuzzer][tools] where the first byte in the fuzz input says which fuzzer to run and then the rest of the input is the input to the fuzzer. This is intended to improve our time-slicing on OSS-Fuzz where less important fuzzers don't hog time from the \"important fuzzers\" such as <code>differential</code>. Some minor-ish fuzzers have been folded in to this new fuzzer, but we can also always move things around as needed</p>\n<p>[tools]: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/blob/main/fuzz/fuzz_targets/run.rs\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-tools/blob/main/fuzz/fuzz_targets/run.rs</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
