However, this is not correct because a <code>gimli::UnitSectionOffset</code> is only unique within its associated <code>gimli::Dwarf</code>.</p>\n<p>Fix by using one graph per <code>gimli::Dwarf</code>.</p>\n<p>In addition to wasmtime's tests, the only testing I have done on this is to compile the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/component-docs/tree/main/component-model/examples/tutorial\">component-docs tutorial</a> using wasmtime and diff the resulting DWARF. That diff showed that this patch does affect which DWARF entries are determined to be reachable.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
