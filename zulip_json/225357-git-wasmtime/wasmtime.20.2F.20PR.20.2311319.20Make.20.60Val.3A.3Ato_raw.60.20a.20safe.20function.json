This was previously marked as <code>unsafe</code> with documentation that the raw pointer could be invalid, but that's not a reason for the function itself to be <code>unsafe</code>. Usage of the returned value is still <code>unsafe</code>, but simply acquiring the value is not itself an unsafe operation.</p>\n<p>This additionally marks a number of GC-related <code>from_raw</code> functions as safe. Wasmtime's GC is safe in the face of heap corruption, so it's memory safe to pass in any 32-bit value. Documentation still indicates that panics are possible, however.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
