Currently the 16-bit shifts <code>vps{ll,ra,rl}w</code> are omitted due to the <code>avx512bw</code> feature not yet being bound in Cranelift. In implementing these instructions a few refactorings/fixes were necessary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Primarily all EVEX instructions now need to be defined not only with their vector length but also their \"tuple type\" found in encoding tables. This is required to correctly handle the 8-bit displacement scaling that happens with EVEX instructions.</li>\n<li>Some small helpers to the <code>Evex</code> structure were added such as <code>Evex::digit</code> and <code>Evex::ib</code>.</li>\n<li>The <code>evex_scaling</code> factor is now calculated in <code>generate_evex_prefix</code> according to the instruction format itself.</li>\n<li>The VEX and EVEX <code>generate_*_prefix</code> functions now delegate to a shared function to handle the same operand formats across both of them.</li>\n<li>Fuzz generation of <code>AmodeOffset</code> is now updated to bias to some \"interesting\" offsets that exercise the cases where EVEX scaling is necessary.</li>\n<li>The ISLE <code>XmmUnaryRmRImmEvex</code> instruction format was removed as it's no longer necessary.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
