We're guaranteed to have to update these in the future but my hope is that the required updates are few and far between so it's not too costly. This is inspired by some breakage on the 24.0.0 branch where for the LTS nature of branches it's probably best to avoid <code>*-latest</code> for any CI container doing something nontrivial.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
