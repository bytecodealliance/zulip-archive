This change upgrades the assembler to understand all kinds of prefixes, even those as yet unused, and drastically increases the amount of documentation around these prefixes. This, along with some new <code>Group</code>-based typing, should prevent accidental misuse but also increase confidence that this implementation is correctly covering the possible cases.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
