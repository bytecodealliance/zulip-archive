That these entities were in <code>FuncTranslationState</code> is a throwback to back when <code>FuncEnvironment</code> was a trait, and not a concrete type.</p>\n<p>Also rename <code>FuncTranslationState</code> to <code>FuncTranslationStacks</code>, since all it does is manage the value and control stacks now.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
