I believe the failure is because currently <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> is blocking requests from <code>curl</code> (<a href=\"https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/318791-t-crates-io/topic/API.20requests.20bounced.20with.20403.20since.20~3.20hours.20ago/near/524709398\">#t-crates-io &gt; API requests bounced with 403 since ~3 hours ago @ ðŸ’¬</a>). If a <code>curl</code> request fails the script currently prints nothing and then the continued logic does not handle its own failure, basically we expect <code>curl</code> to succeed. My hope is that by adding <code>--user-agent</code> it can indeed succeed, and then additionally extra info is printed on failure to help diagnose this in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>",
