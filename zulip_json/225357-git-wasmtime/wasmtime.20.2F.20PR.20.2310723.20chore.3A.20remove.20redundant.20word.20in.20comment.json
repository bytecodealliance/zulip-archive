This PR after updates has two other issues: (i) you're editing WIT files, and we have a CI check to see that they are the same as upstream (they are vendored sources); (ii) you introduce a random file in the root, <code>contributor.txt</code>.</p>\n<p>My reasoning above stands -- small fixes are welcome, but they need to actually be fixes, and not introduce other problems; I don't really want to encourage a sort of low-effort typo-fix contribution where contributors are not making efforts to actually check things. All the best!</p>\n</blockquote>",
