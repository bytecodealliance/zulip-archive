Previously this was entirely unsupported because fibers use inline assembly. The implementation with Miri spawns a separate thread and keeps it in a suspended state with locks to model a suspended stack. This technically isn't correct because TLS variables will be wrong, but it's \"correct enough\" for our usage in Wasmtime. In the end this enables running more tests in Miri which is always a good thing, and a number of loose odds and ends were cleaned up relate to our unsafe management of async state.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
