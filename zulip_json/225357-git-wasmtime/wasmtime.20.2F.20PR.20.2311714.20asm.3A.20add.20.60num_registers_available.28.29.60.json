We assume for now that legacy instructions can always emit the REX prefix and thus access 16 registers; thus, the only encoding that allows access to 32 registers is EVEX.</p>\n<p>This also refactors some of the top-level generation logic to be less verbose.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
