If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;<br>\nA simple refactor to rename <code>VectorExtendKind</code> to <code>V128LoadExtendKind</code>. The reason why being that I need to introduce a _kind_ enum for the V128 extend instructions and <code>V128ExtendKind</code> seems like it would be a suitable name. The <code>VectorExtendKind</code> enum is only used by the SIMD _load and extend_ instructions so it seems appropriate to me to incorporate that it's specific to loads in the name.</p>\n</blockquote>",
