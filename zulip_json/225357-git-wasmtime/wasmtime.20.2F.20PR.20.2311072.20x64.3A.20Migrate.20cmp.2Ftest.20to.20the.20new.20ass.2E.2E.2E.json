This required fiddling with various helpers for immediates and such throughout a few locations and refactoring various callsites of creating these instructions to fit nicely into these new idioms. EFLAGS-writing instructions with no other results are now also modeled in the assembler as <code>ProducesFlags</code> rather than <code>SideEffectNoResult</code> as their base case enabling using the generated constructors a bit more too.</p>\n<p>No functional change is expected from this, it should just be internal refactoring.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
