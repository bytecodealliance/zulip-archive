Currently, the polyfill is just an identity function, because <code>wasmtime::Result</code>/<code>wasmtime_environ::error::Result</code> is just another name for <code>anyhow::Result</code>. Once we do move away from <code>anyhow</code>, however, that will no longer be the case, and these uses will do the necessary conversion.</p>\n<p>My goal with landing this as an incremental commit is to make it so that the actual commit that does the error crate swap out can be as close to _just_ the <code>Cargo.toml</code> dependency change, without any other code changes as much as possible. This, in turn, means that swap out should be super easy to revert, if necessary.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

I agree though with all your points about why this trait generally isn't needed, and it's clear that it's not pervasively needed throughout.</p>\n<p>I think you're right as well that, in this workspace, trying to sometimes use <code>wasmtime::Error</code> and sometimes use <code>anyhow::Error</code> probably isn't worth it. That would remove the need for this conversion trait in this workspace but at too high of a conceptual cost.</p>\n<p>Personally though I'm still not a fan of this trait. Idiomatically in Rust everyone expects <code>?</code> to handle type conversion of errors, so requiring a trait + <code>.to_wasmtime_result()</code> call is pretty unintuitive. I understand there's no better solution given our technical constraints, however. One learning, perhaps, is that it's the fault of the libraries in question for producing some sort of error that doesn't implement the <code>Error</code> trait (e.g. <code>anyhow::Error</code>). The libraries in question are apparently all me-inflicting-pain-on-myself:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>wasmprinter</li>\n<li>wit-component</li>\n<li>wasm-compose</li>\n<li>pulley profiling</li>\n<li>json-from-wast</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I think it would be reasonable to update these libraries to have a more dedicated error-type-per-library which does indeed implement the <code>Error</code> trait for any one particular error. That would mean that the majority of the conversions in this PR aren't necessary.</p>\n<p>Question for you though, the other instance in this PR is the updates to the <code>cranelift-{fuzzgen,icache}</code> targets fuzz targets. I think we control the code in question, right? Is that perhaps more code to transition to <code>wasmtime::Error</code>, or a concrete error, as opposed to <code>anyhow::Error</code>? Because otherwise the current state of affairs is the confusion we're trying to avoid, where the internal libraries are using <code>anyhow</code> but shouldn't?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>also probably something that doesn't need to happen in this PR, I don't think? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Agreed yeah, the <code>bindgen!</code> changes should be separate (sorry just wanted to write it down before I forgot and I was writing here). </p>\n<p>If you're ok with it I'd prefer to block landing the actual switchover until this PR is implemented, but I would hope that this PR would be pretty easy to do.</p>\n</blockquote>",
