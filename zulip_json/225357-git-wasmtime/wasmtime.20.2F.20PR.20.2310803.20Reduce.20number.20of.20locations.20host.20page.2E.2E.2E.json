It looks like this usage of <code>rustix</code> is causing a panic in #10802 and additionally it's best to only have one source for this, so this commit updates this all to route through our preexisting <code>host_page_size</code> function.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
