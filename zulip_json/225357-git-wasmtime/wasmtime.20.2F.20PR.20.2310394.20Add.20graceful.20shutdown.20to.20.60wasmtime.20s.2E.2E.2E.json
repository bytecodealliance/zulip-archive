The problem here is that the infrastructure for testing <code>wasmtime serve</code> was not properly waiting for all output in <code>finish</code>. There's some infrastructure in the tests for spawning a subprocess and managing it, but prior to this commit there was no way to shut down the server gracefully and thus read all pending output from the child tasks.</p>\n<p>The specific problem is that a specific error message was expected in the logs after a request had been processed, but the <code>finish</code> method wasn't reading the message. The reason for this is that <code>finish</code> had to resort to <code>kill -9</code> on the child process as there was no other means of shutting it down. This meant that the print, which happened after request completion, might be killed and never happen.</p>\n<p>The solution ended up in this commit is to (a) add a <code>--shutdown-addr</code> CLI flag to <code>wasmtime serve</code> and (b) beef up handling of graceful shutdown. Previously ctrl-c was used to exit the server but it didn't do anything but drop all in-progress work. Instead graceful shutdown is now handled by breaking out of the <code>accept</code> loop and then waiting for all child tasks to complete, meaning that no http requests once received are cancelled. In addition to ctrl-c the <code>--shutdown-addr</code> is used to listen for a TCP connection which is a second means of cancellation. The reason for this is that sending ctrl-c to a process is not nearly as trivial on Windows as it is on Unix, so I didn't want to deal with all the console bits necessary to get that aligned.</p>\n<p>[fail]: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/13833291117/job/38702374924?pr=10390\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/actions/runs/13833291117/job/38702374924?pr=10390</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
