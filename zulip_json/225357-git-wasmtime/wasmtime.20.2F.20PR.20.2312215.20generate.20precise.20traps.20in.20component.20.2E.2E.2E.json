However, that metadata was never hooked up to anything, so we only got a generic <code>unreachable</code> message at runtime.</p>\n<p>This commit removes the metadata tracking and instead simply calls a host intrinsic, passing the trap code as a parameter.  This is somewhate pessimal compared with what we had before, but improves ergonomics and allows us to avoid forking as many tests from the component-model repo.</p>\n<p>If performance becomes an issue, we can easily add an option to skip the host call and only emit an <code>unreachable</code> instruction as before.</p>\n<p>Note that I've removed forked versions of three tests in favor of their upstream equivalents.</p>\n<p>Fixes #11683</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
