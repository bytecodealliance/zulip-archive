Since this PR was opened I think <code>jiff</code> was released which might be more modern.</li>\n<li>Does <code>chrono</code> or <code>chrono-tz</code> have any sort of system dependency on something like a timezone database? If so, are there any consequences to that? If not should it? Or will we need to update frequently?</li>\n<li>What's the build/size impact of including <code>chrono</code> and <code>chrono-tz</code>? Adding 10M to the executable? 10K?</li>\n<li>We're generally pretty conservative with the defaults of a WASI program, so it might make more sense to default to UTC instead of the local timezone maybe?</li>\n<li>This PR has been pretty inactive for ~2 years and now mergable without much discussion here. That's understandable though if the discussion happened upstream. Do you have links and/or confirmation for others that it's suitable to add this at this time? (or is there no such body that makes sense to confirm this decision?)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",

For example does most software bundle the database? Use an external database? (I'm new to timezones in this regard). Basically is Wasmtime doing the \"standard thing\" here? Or do we know if <code>chrono</code> is non-standard in any way?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I will try out jiff as a replacement and report the difference in build size.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To clarify I'm mostly just curious if it was considered. I do not know how to evaluate tradeoffs so I'm relying on expert advice in this area. I, myself, am not equipped to render judgment on a <code>chrono</code>-vs-<code>jiff</code> decision so what I'm trying to do is ask leading questions. My hope is to read the analysis of someone else's judgment and see if I have further questions or whether we can link to that in the future for example.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I don't doubt that many embedders will want to change this but Wasmtime's default stance has been one to sandbox everything and picking a deterministic default feels more sand-box-y to me than inferring based on the host system. For embedders that want to use the native time zone though I'd want to make sure we can easily enable that with a single call on <code>WasiCtxBuilder</code>, for example.</p>\n</blockquote>",

By default wasmtime doesn't give any environment variables to the guest, but the <code>WasiCtxBuilder</code> structure has methods to pass environment variables. The default behavior of \"nothing\" doesn't mean that the implementation of environment variabls is pointless it's just the default behavior.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking the same thing for time zones. By default it's UTC, but embedders can easily configure \"use this time zone instead\" where \"this\" could be something specific or the system's local time zone. I'm not sure why this behavior would lead to the implementation having no role in Wasmtime. Wasmtime is still providing functionality, time zones and information, and embedders can configure which time zone is reported.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Today, there is nothing technically stopping someone from using timezones in their component and setting the timezone to UTC or whatever timezone they want. If they want to enable host timezone access, they would need something like what this PR provides.<br>\nIf we want that functionality not to be enabled by default then that's fine. Perhaps that is what you mean. </p>\n<p>Where I'm coming from people expect their Wasm applications to work just like their native code. For C2PA, all of our tests run with <code>-S cli -S http --dir .</code>. Too many WASI specific code paths and it just isn't worth the hassle to maintain.<br>\nIf <code>--dir</code> isn't passed and and file access is denied, then the code panics. Likewise if people don't want the system timezone, then they shouldn't pass the feature flag. If they do want it, then it should just work as like the native code, which is their expectation.</p>\n</blockquote>",
