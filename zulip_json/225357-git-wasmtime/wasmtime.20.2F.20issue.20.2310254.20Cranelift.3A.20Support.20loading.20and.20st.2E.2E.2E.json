Some of these vector types may be smaller than 128bit. Previously these vector types didn't need to be exposed to Cranelift as all vector operations are emulated by cg_clif using scalar operations. However now that they are passed in vector registers, cg_clif needs to use vector types at the ABI level and thus needs to support loading and storing small vectors.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>TODO: Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>\nalgorithms to use?</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>Have a bunch of code in cg_clif dedicated to handling this. I probably need this anyway for the time being, but I prefer if I can get rid of it as soon as possible through native Cranelift support.</p>\n</blockquote>",
