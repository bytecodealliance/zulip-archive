I tried modifying the CMakeLists.txt with:</p>\n<p>set(WASMTIME_USER_CARGO_BUILD_OPTIONS \"--features=cranelift,gc\" CACHE STRING \"Additional cargo flags (such as --features) to apply to the build command\")</p>\n<p>But it doesn't seem to work. I want to build wasmtime.dll for windows with exception handling so that I can run Lua in wasmtime-dotnet. (I'm doing work for the OPC Foundation to enable constraint handling)</p>\n<p>Thanks,</p>\n<p>Peter.</p>\n</blockquote>",

You just build your Wasm module and if it happens to call setjmp then it just gets handled.

From our support table the C API doesn't support exceptions currently, so that's our current baseline. Wasm proposals have a process of being implemented and stabilized in Wasmtime, also linked from that documentation. Exception support is not \"done\" to be on-by-default currently, as the linked documentation indicates.</p>\n<p>Building in support for exceptions will require the \"gc\" feature in the long term, and in the near term it requires explicit opt-in as it's not a stable proposal in Wasmtime.</p>\n</blockquote>",
