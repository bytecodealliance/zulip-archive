To me it feels reasonable to expect that patch releases of Wasmtime by default do not affect the ABI of <code>*.cwasm</code> artifacts and thus we should allow by default loading previous versions. This can help embedders avoid recompiles and can additionally assist in more quickly deploying security updates as recompilation is unnecessary.</p>\n<p>The concrete change in this commit is that instead of baking in <code>CARGO_PKG_VERSION</code> into the cwasm artifact instead <code>CARGO_PKG_VERSION_MAJOR</code> is baked in. This means that the patch release is \"forgotten\" and won't be compared.</p>\n<p>This commit also updates documentation for patch releases to indicate that this should be double-checked on patch releases. Furthermore we can always update the string ourselves manually (e.g. to include a \".2\" at the end or something like that) if an ABI break is actually needed. This mostly just changes the default of patch releases by default don't break ABI but we still can if we really need to for a particular issue.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
