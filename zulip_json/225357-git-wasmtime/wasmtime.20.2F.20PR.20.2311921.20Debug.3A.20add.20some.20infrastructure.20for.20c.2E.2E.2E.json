In short, disabling signal-based traps on a Pulley configuration still relies on Pulley opcodes (e.g., divide) actually trapping, in a way that looks more like a \"native ISA trap\"; so I had to start to build out the actual trap-handling mechanisms. In any case, this will all be needed for followup work soon that will handle traps on native platforms (redirecting from signals by injecting calls), so this is not a distraction.</p>\n<p>This PR includes, ranked in decreasing order of \"may scare other Wasmtime maintainers\" score:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A raw <code>NonNull&lt;dyn VMStore&gt;</code> in the <code>CallThreadState</code>, with a long comment about provenance and mut-borrow exclusivity. This is needed right now to allow the interpreter to invoke the debug event handler, but will soon be needed when injecting hostcalls on signals, because a signal context also has no state available from the Wasm code other than what is in TLS. Hence, we need a way to get the store back from the Wasm when we do something that is \"morally a hostcall\" at a trapping instruction.</p>\n<p>I do believe this is sound, or at least close to it if not (please scrutinize carefully!); the basic idea is that the Wasm acts as an opaque blob in the middle, and the pointer comes out of it one way or another (the normal way, as the first arg to a hostcall, or the weird way, via TLS and the CallThreadState during a trap). Exclusive ownership is still clear at any given point and only one <code>&amp;mut</code> ever exists in the current frame at a time. That said, I haven't tested with miri yet.</p>\n<p>This does require careful thought about the Wasm compilation, too; we need the moral equivalent of a <code>&amp;mut self</code> reborrow as-if we were making a hostcall on each trapping instruction. It turns out that we already treat them as memory-fence instructions, so nothing loaded from the store can be moved or cached across them, and I've added a comment now about how this is load-bearing.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Updates to <code>CallThreadState</code>'s \"exit state\", normally set by the exit trampoline, that we now also set when we invoke a debug event handler during a trap context[^1] so that <code>Store::debug_frames</code> properly sees the current activation.

That Store fundamentally has to know about the last activation so it can provide a view into those frames (via <code>debug_frames</code>). The way that we view the stack depends on exactly how the host entry occurred, and a trap is a new kind of host entry -- previously we didn't actually enter all that far into host code, only far enough to do the <code>raise</code> and return back out on the other side. There's no direct call-parameter dataflow we can add this onto; we aren't calling into the debug handler with some special thing that already has interpreted the debug frames, we're giving it the full Store. In particular, a trapping context means that we interpret PC differently: it points to the trapping instruction, not the instruction-after as in calls. So this logically belongs with the \"end of the last activation\" state: it's required to interpret the exit PC/FP. Also, because there's no trampoline, reusing <code>last_wasm_exit_trampoline_fp</code> is the wrong choice I think.</p>\n<p>I also share your unease with the ugliness here, and I think the one possible cleanup I see is to refactor back to storing the last Wasm FP, not trampoline FP.

We currently have a bunch of places low in the abstraction stack where we <em>only</em> have the Cranelift-level function builder, and some raw SSA values, and we're generating logic that could trap. Previously this was fine because we just added a static trap code indicating the kind of trap, and SourceLocs already track where we are. Now we need more metadata, e.g. for the stack shape. So fundamentally we need to carry that somehow and we have <em>no</em> Wasmtime-specific place to hang it now.)</p>\n</blockquote>",

That might involve a fiber/thread switch which means that resumption on another thread would break the <code>tls::with</code> block.</p>\n<p>Somehow, I'm not sure how best how, but the invocation of the debug handler needs to be outside of <code>tls::with</code>. This is also why I tried really hard recently to get all async invocations to \"the libcall calls it and nothing else\" and this is effectively a regression from that where we're back to the state of \"deep in the bowels of the runtime all of a sudden there's a fiber switch\".</p>\n<p>Basically I think this might be worth rethinking how the async interface is implemented in the runtime. For example something should have prevented this construction in the first place via some sort of \"need to be in <code>async</code> context but not safely in an <code>async</code> context\".</p>\n</blockquote>",

I think that this may be miri-unsound at a first glance (but I've got about a 70% hit rate on predicting this so not great). The <code>dyn VMStore</code> is passed to <code>CallThreadState::new</code> which gets a raw pointer from that, but immediately later the store is accessed <code>store.0.executor()</code> which I believe effectively invalidates the previously acquired mutable pointer.</li>\n<li>In general I don't really understand the provenance comment here. My understanding is that the invariant we need to uphold is that (a) when we enter wasm we start with a safe <code>VMStore</code>reference and (b) when in wasm all usage of <code>VMStore</code> is derived from either that raw pointers or other raw pointers originally derived. I don't know why that would limit usage of the store to just the trap handler or why Cranelift's optimizations or such would come into play here. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Put another way, if this field exists then I think other store-related fields should all be deleted to avoid having state to keep in sync. Taking this provenance comment as-is means that it's not actually possible to do that because the field can only be used during traps, but I don't think that's accurate which means that I don't think the comment here is accurate.</p>\n<p>For Miri-things I think ideally a <code>CallThreadState</code> would have a lifetime parameter which is a phantom borrow of the <code>&amp;'a mut dyn VMStore</code> which logically ensures that while the <code>CallThreadState</code> is active all usage of the store must be derived from the state itself rather than via external borrows.</p>\n</blockquote>",

That fourth context is then the only context passed everywhere and methods/etc are all updated to be on the fourth context.

I should definitely do that.</p>\n<p>That said, a few thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>I agree a broader refactor to have just a <code>dyn VMStore</code> pop out the other side of <code>CallThreadState</code> would actually be ideal, then make this well-tested, well-vetted, and standardize on it. In general it seems like we've plumbed through <em>just enough</em> state for the things that we do need when we get control without a vmctx; doing this right once would be best.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I tried to limit this to \"during traps\" to make the distinction about whether we have a <code>vmctx</code> passed in via a normal hostcall route or not. Basically, there is always one way that the root of ownership of the store passes back into the host: either via TLS -&gt; CallThreadState -&gt; VMStoreContext -&gt; raw VMStore pointer (trap route) or via vmctx -&gt; <code>Instance</code> -&gt; store pointer (<code>Instance::enter_store_from_wasm</code> route for libcalls).</p>\n<p>Technically I don't see a reason why we couldn't <em>always</em> use the TLS route, except for the obvious one, performance (and then the fiber-suspend one which you raise below, about which more thoughts below...).</p>\n<p>All of this hinges on my understanding of provenance which is that (true mut borrow) -&gt; (multiple raw pointers) -&gt; (true mut borrow derived from one of those raw pointers) is safe, i.e., you can pick one of multiple dataflow paths to get your raw pointer, and the others are just invalidated and must not be used. That should be what's going on here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>On Cranelift optimizations: we're accustomed to thinking about Wasm as opaque, and considering only the provenance story on the Rust side, but it's important to think about what provenance means in a general compiler sense and ensuring we're not committing the same sins on the other side. In particular, if we have an implicit hostcall on trap, that's as-if we create a new <code>&amp;mut Store</code>, so just as provenance exists as a concern on the Rust side because language semantics around aliasing are load-bearing for optimizations, we have alias analysis and optimizations on the Cranelift side too. My point there is that we must ensure we have no cached state loaded from the store across any trapping instruction if we do this implicit hostcall thing; that would be exactly equivalent to an exclusive-mut-borrow violation on the Rust side. The reason this is discussed at all in this context is that we are taking the <code>&amp;mut dyn VMStore</code> now and using it, so we're creating this limitation on the Cranelift side. One depends on the other.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",

A few overall thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>In parallel to this, over in #11930, I have started to realize that injecting implicit hostcalls during traps may not be worth the complexity given variations in signal-handling quirks between platforms (got it working on Linux but each of macOS and Windows need different design bits). If that goes away and we require hostcall-based traps everywhere, then the only remaining \"debugger gets control outside of a libcall\" situation is Pulley's use of trapping instructions (e.v. my div-by-zero test which this PR enables), and there I'd prefer to refactor to make Pulley use true hostcall-based traps in those cases too.</p>\n<p>So if we go that way, we avoid the need to re-enter the runtime without a <code>vmctx</code> passed to us the normal way; and all of these ownership/provenance questions go away.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>That said: I realize I'm fighting a somewhat uphill battle on store provenance, but I do suspect it might be a need elsewhere in the future, for example if we do want to enable signal-based traps in debugging for performance later. At a high level the ownership handoff is dynamically valid; and the overall scheme should be compatible with stacked borrows (one mut borrow -&gt; multiple raw pointers -&gt; one mut borrow derived from one of them). I'm happy to keep talking about this and try for a refactor where we shift to one raw store pointer in the <code>CallThreadState</code> and derive other things (unsafe-intrinsics' <code>T</code> pointer, the <code>VMStoreContext</code>, ...) from that. That would give us a framework with fewer limitations for future work. The trick is finding the right abstraction for a safe API, I think...</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>That also said, it occurs to me that the <code>Accessor</code> mechanism, with its TLS mechanism already vetted, could be an alternate foundation for all of this. (We already know it's the eventual alternate foundation for all of this, but I mean even in a callback world.) Basically, transfer ownership of the debug handler if any to the CallThreadState on entry and take back on exit; then that's <em>all</em> we need to invoke the handler, and it can keep its locally captured <code>Access</code>.</p>\n<p>I don't necessarily want to create a dependency on all of the refactoring you are planning to do around that, though...</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
