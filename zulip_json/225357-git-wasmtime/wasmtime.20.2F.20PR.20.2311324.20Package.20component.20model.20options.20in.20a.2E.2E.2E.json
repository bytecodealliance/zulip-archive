Previously options were \"exploded\" meaning that options were all passed around as parameters but this was a bummer for a few reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>This is <code>unsafe</code>-prone as options have raw pointers such as memory and functions. This meant that all functions/operations working with options were fundamentally <code>unsafe</code>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>This was unwieldy as the set of options continues to grow larger over time. The <code>VMLoweringCallee</code> function previously had 10+ parameters, most of which were canonical ABI options.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To solve these two problems options are now intern'd at compile time to an <code>OptionsIndex</code>, a 32-bit value. This is stored as a new table in component metadata and consulted at runtime. This means that <code>OptionsIndex</code> can be passed around with an instance for a much safer means of threading options around. Additionally there's no need to pass around all parameters individually and instead just one parameter, <code>OptionsIndex</code>, need be threaded through.</p>\n<p>This commit additionally overhauls trampoline generation for the component compiler to avoid a function-per-intrinsic and instead have a single function that all intrinsics use. I found this easier to understand and helps codify that all intrinsics are basically the same with some minor details differing between them.</p>\n<p>The end result of this is (hopefully) a net simplification of the component compiler in addition to a large amount of removal of <code>unsafe</code> code in the async implementation as only safe types are passed around now instead of raw pointers.</p>\n<p>Closes #10143<br>\nCloses #11188</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
