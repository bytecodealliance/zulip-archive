Did we lose some useful fuzzing functionality at that point? If so, maybe we should revive this issue. If the dummy generator doesn't need this level of complexity though, I guess we should close this issue as well as #2535.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The <code>wasm-encoder</code> crate has builder methods that should make it pretty straightforward to translate the <code>WatGenerator</code> into a <code>WasmGenerator</code>.</p>\n<p>If you want to work on this issue, leave a comment, and let me know whatever questions you have!</p>\n<p>Info for getting up and running with contributing: <a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
