For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#missing_safety_doc\"><code>missing_safety_doc</code></a> - this would help ensure that <code># Safety</code> sections are available on all <code>unsafe</code> functions.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#multiple_unsafe_ops_per_block\"><code>multiple_unsafe_ops_per_block</code></a> - this would help ensure that <code>// SAFETY: ...</code> documentation for an <code>unsafe</code> block is accurately describing just one unsafe operation, not multiple by accident. This might also help over time where new unsafety couldn't get introduced in a block by accident without explaining why it's valid.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/master/index.html#multiple_unsafe_ops_per_block\"><code>undocumented_unsafe_blocks</code></a> - this would ensure that all unsafe blocks have a comment explaining their rationale.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To be clear though I do not believe that it would be helpful to blanket require this for the workspace all at once. Writing lots of trivial <code>// SAFETY</code> documentation that doesn't do anything more than the obvious is not going to be helpful and will otherwise introduce a lot of noise. Nevertheless though I do think there's a world in which we could perhaps migrate a module-at-a-time to enabling these lints (or maybe even function-at-a-time if modules are too coarse-grained). Over time more and more of the <code>wasmtime</code> crate would be held to a higher standard and eventually the entire crate would use these lints (or some subset).</p>\n</blockquote>",
