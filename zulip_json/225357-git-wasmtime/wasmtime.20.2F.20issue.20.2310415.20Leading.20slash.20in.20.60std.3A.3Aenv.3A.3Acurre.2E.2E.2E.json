I fear though that I may not have great news for you as this is not going to be an easy bug to fix.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately this has nothing to do with Wasmtime, it's got everything to do with the guest program itself. However it's also not entirely fair (IMO) to \"point the finger of blame\" at the guest program. In the end this is basically a situation that's not super well supported today.</p>\n<p>To elaborate on that, what's happening here is, as you've seen, a clash of Windows an Unix paths. Windows understands that the leading <code>D:/</code> is a drive prefix but to a unix path system (which WASI targets use currently) there's no knowledge of the <code>D:/</code> prefix so it looks like a folder name, meaning <code>\"/\".join(\"D:/\")</code> produces <code>\"/D:/\"</code>. The default current directory is set in wasi-libc itself which is <code>/</code> by default (as you've seen), so changing the current directory to <code>D:/...</code> is interpreted in a similar manner to <code>set_current_dir(\"foo\")</code> which would change to <code>/foo</code>. Effectively WASI and wasi-libc are using a unix-like filesystem format and there's nothing on Windows to do any sort of translation between the two.</p>\n<p>The question is then somewhat: \"who should do this translation?\" A reasonable answer is \"wasmtime!\" but unfortunately the tools aren't in place for that right now. For example to Wasmtime this is \"just another env var\" being passed to the program and it has no idea that <code>PWD</code> is in fact a path. Wasmtime would then additionally need to have some sort of translation understanding that when mounting the root path there's some sort of understanding/translation to access the various drives. This is all theoretically possible but not set up today.</p>\n<p>So in essence the problem you're running into is that when giving access to the whole filesystem to windows guest someone or something will have to do translation of windows paths. As-is today something would have to translate <code>D:/...</code> to something unix-like (like <code>/d/...</code>) and would need to translate both ways (e.g. passing paths to the guest and processing paths received from the guest as well). My gut is that something in <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> probably wants to do this as opposed to guest programs and/or changes to wasi-libc, but I'm not actually sure what that would look like. Overall I don't think we've sufficiently filled out functionality in \"give the guest access to the entire host drive\" in Wasmtime, which is where this is all stemming from.</p>\n<p>cc @sunfishcode this seems like the kind of bug/issue you might be interested in being aware of </p>\n</blockquote>",
