This looks pretty good to me, but I'd also want to test some more integration-y things before landing. To that end can you try a few things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a commit to this PR with \"prtest:full\" somewhere in the commit message so we can see the full CI run</li>\n<li>With a full run I want to double-check that the header file is present in the installation artifacts</li>\n<li>Mind updating <code>crates/c-api/README.md</code> with a mention that the C++ API is present as well? I can also do this as a follow-up if you'd prefer.</li>\n<li>With a full run I want to double-check that the docs here are present in the c-api docs.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
