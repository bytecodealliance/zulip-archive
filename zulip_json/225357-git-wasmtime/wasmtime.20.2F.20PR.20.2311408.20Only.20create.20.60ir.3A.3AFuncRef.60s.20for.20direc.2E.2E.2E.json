This commit makes it so that we delay <code>ir::FuncRef</code> creation until we actually emit a direct call.</p>\n<p>Also I found that we were not looking for already-created <code>ir::SigRef</code>s when creating <code>ir::FuncRef</code>s, so I fixed that as well, which removes a couple duplicate signature definitions in our disas tests.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
