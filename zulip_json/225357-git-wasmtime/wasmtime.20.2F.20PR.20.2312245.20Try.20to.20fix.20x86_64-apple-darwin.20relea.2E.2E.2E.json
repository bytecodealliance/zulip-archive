Effectively it looks like <code>#[unsafe(naked)]</code> is buggy to the point that the user of the function symbol must be <code>#[inline(never)]</code> and in the same module, otherwise it won't work correctly.</p>\n<p>Closes #12217</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
