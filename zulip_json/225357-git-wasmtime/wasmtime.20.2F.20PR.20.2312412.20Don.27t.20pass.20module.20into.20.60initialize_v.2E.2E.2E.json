Historically I don't recall this being a problem here exactly, but we have at least one bug report showing a 30% slowdown in throughput for an optimized host function if we include an <code>Arc::clone</code> by accident.</p>\n<p>Instead of a clone, however, how about something like <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/f70298c80eab08302f12ceee7de6b06ff81ab958/crates/wasmtime/src/runtime/vm/component.rs#L808-L820\">what components do</a>?</p>\n</blockquote>",
