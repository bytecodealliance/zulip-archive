Currently, the combination of the minimal build not having GC, but the default assumption of GC support being true and no C API to set it to false results in a panic when creating the engine.</p>\n<h4>Benefit</h4>\n<p>To be able to use <code>wasmtime-go</code> (or any other SDK that uses the C API) to embed the minimal wasmtime build into an application when Cranelift, GC, etc. aren't needed and wanting to minimize the size of the compiled application.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>I think exposing <code>config.gc_support(false)</code> to the C API would be the most straightforward and useful beyond the minimal build use case.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>Packaging the minimal build in such a way that it defaults to returning false for GC support since it lacks GC.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

I also think that for builds that don't include GC support, ideally the <code>config</code> would default to <code>false</code> as well, since the current default doesn't make much sense.</p>\n<p>Would you be up for working on adding this, @effulgentsia?</p>\n</blockquote>",
