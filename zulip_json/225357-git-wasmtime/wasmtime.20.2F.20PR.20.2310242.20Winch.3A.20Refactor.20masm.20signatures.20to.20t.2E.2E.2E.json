If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;<br>\nRefactors a number of SIMD methods in the macroassembler interface to take various kind enums. For most of these operations, I want to introduce support for floats and the existing interfaces don't make that very straightforward. I also updated <code>extadd</code> and <code>extmul</code> for the sake of consistency.</p>\n<p>This change also allows potentially reusing some of the conversions between macroassembler kinds in a future AArch64 implementation.</p>\n</blockquote>",
