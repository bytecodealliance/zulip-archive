I've found conflicting notes online, and first-principles thinking suggests that <code>andb %rA, %rB</code> should be no worse than <code>andl %rA, %rB</code> from a data-dependency perspective: both are reading (some part or all) of rA and rB as a source, and writing to rB. Updating only the low part of rB doesn't change that; said update-merge would require the unchanged high bits of rB as input, but we're already reading rB as input.</p>\n<p>However some sources indicate that a separate merge uop is needed on some microarchitectures when a narrow operation occurs -- internally this is thus executed as the 8-bit AND, then an \"insert 8 bits into low 8 bits of original 64-bit register\" microinstruction.</p>\n<p>I've found evidence of this even on very new processors -- on my two-month-old Zen 5 machine (Ryzen 9950X) I see that this code</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">bits</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">64</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">global</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">main</span>\n<span class=\"n\">main</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nc\">mov</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">rax</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"mi\">1000</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">xor</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">rcx</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">rcx</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">_l</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nc\">and</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">dl</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">cl</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">sub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">rax</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">jnz</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">_l</span>\n\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">ret</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>runs about 5% slower than this code</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">bits</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">64</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">global</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">main</span>\n<span class=\"n\">main</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nc\">mov</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">rax</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">10</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"mi\">1000</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"mi\">1000</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">xor</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">rcx</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">rcx</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">_l</span><span class=\"p\">:</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"nc\">and</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">edx</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ecx</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">sub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">rax</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">1</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">jnz</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">_l</span>\n\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">ret</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>(build both with <code>nasm -felf64 test.asm -o test.o ; gcc test.o -o test</code>). This indicates that some sort of merging is still happening.</p>\n<p>The 32-bit case is different because AMD was wise in defining 32-bit ops to clear the upper bits of a 64-bit register when in long mode. But it seems for 8 and 16 bit cases, there is merging behavior that we want to avoid. The memory cases are different because the operand size matters for the load width, of course.</p>\n<p>This all suggests that we should keep the status-quo in lowering rules, <em>and also</em> maybe reconsider our pattern around <code>SETcc</code>: <code>setnz al</code> when reifying a condition into a flag (<code>icmp</code> without branch fusion) is going to have a false dependency on whatever was previously in <code>rax</code>. We can break it by using a zeroing idiom recognized by the renamer, e.g. <code>xor rax, rax</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Like @cfallin, I suspected we wanted to break the false dependency but the overall effect of this is tedious to measure and not always conclusive.</p>\n<p>As you all know I built a bunch of \"benchmark results over time\" infrastructure for Sightglass some time ago but abandoned the effort once it became clear I would have to maintain a benchmarking server in perpetuity. @jlb6740 tried to get this kind of thing automated into our CI, but the integration friction is likely what discourages its use. What about codspeed, though? Their criterion-compatible shim uses Valgrind for what they claim are stable results and they're working on a wall-time version as well. Here's an example of the \"results over time\" they capture: <a href=\"https://codspeed.io/nuxt/nuxt/benchmarks/packages/kit/test/load-nuxt-config.bench.ts::loadNuxtConfig::loadNuxtConfig%20in%20the%20basic%20test%20fixture\">example</a>.</p>\n<p>This crazy benchmarking talk may seem like a tangent, but I think measuring \"results over time\" is what is going to help us most with this kind of issue _and_ with finding other issues of the same sort.</p>\n</blockquote>",

What about codspeed, though? ... I think measuring \"results over time\" is what is going to help us most with this kind of issue and with finding other issues of the same sort.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I completely agree with your thinking here and I would love to see continuous benchmarking over time. I've never used codspeed myself but if they can run in our own CI and generate stable reports I see no reason to not use them myself. We'd probably have to think a bit harder about what exactly to benchmark since right now I believe <code>cargo bench</code> probably takes a few hours to execute by default and doesn't include anything on Sightglass. That being said we can likely pretty easily start folding things in and tweaking the defaults to be more useful</p>\n</blockquote>",
