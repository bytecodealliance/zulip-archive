Rename \"mie2\" to \"mie3\" throughout the code base.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Now that we can use inline asm, use the STORE FACILITY LIST EXTENDED instruction rather than HWCAP to detect facilities at run time.  This eliminates the libc crate dependency, and allows for more fine-grained feature detection.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add support for the z16 (arch14) CPU names (these do not provide any facilities that would be relevant to cranelift, but it should be possible to use these names as synonyms to z15 at least).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add support for the z17 (arch15) CPU names, and two new facilities provided at this level: the Miscellaneous-Instruction-Extensions Facility 4 and the Vector-Enhancements Facility 3.  (Note that no code to exploit these facilities is present in this patch; that will be provided later.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
