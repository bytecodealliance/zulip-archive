This is likely just an artifact of copying the implementation from <code>wasmtime run</code> but for <code>wasmtime serve</code> it needs to be different.</p>\n<p>This puts performance of <code>-Wtimeout=1</code>-and-not back on the same playing field, as expected.</p>\n<p>Closes #11814</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
