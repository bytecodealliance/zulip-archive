It's also non-standard behavior in the sense that it's not specified in WASI itself, so it should be ok to tweak it's behavior over time. While the error is shuffled around disabling TCP and/or UDP still has the same effect where you can't do anything TCP/UDP-related once the options are disabled.</p>\n</blockquote>",
