However, in certain situations, such as when loading from a table when Spectre mitigations are enabled, we rely on that load being attempted and resulting in a trap if the table index is out of bounds. This commit makes it so that we will always perform the load if our given <code>ir::MemFlags</code> can trap.</p>\n<p>Fixes #10353</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
