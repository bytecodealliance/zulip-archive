Before landing mind also expanding the PR description with some rationale for the expected use cases?</p>\n<p>Bikeshedding wise I might say <code>to_val</code> instead of <code>as_val</code> since \"as\" implies \"cheap\" typically and this definitely isn't cheap. I'd also bikeshed the signature a bit to use <code>StoreContextMut&lt;T&gt;</code> rather than <code>impl AsContextMut</code> to avoid the extra indirection of <code>impl Trait</code> where possible.</p>\n<p>The <code>'static</code> bounds popping up on futures/streams is fine, those are only really practically usable with <code>'static</code> types anyway, so I don't think that'll be an issue. The specifics of <code>as_val</code> for futures/streams I think will want to be re-worked a bit too to avoid manually creating structs, but I can take a closer look once this is closer to landing.</p>\n<p>Similar to futures/streams I'll need to think a bit harder about the <code>try_as_resource_any</code> method added here for resources. I forget exactly where we are on clone/copy/etc on those and how it affects what we document in terms of guarantees and whatnot.</p>\n</blockquote>",
