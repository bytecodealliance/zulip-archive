This is similar to #10938 where I have no concrete reason for doing this other than to de-risk the release branch further. The support landed in #11123 is not usable without future PRs that'll land in the near future, but these PRs won't be backported either. This means that it's a large refactoring on the release branch which while it shouldn't have any affect on things it seems best to de-risk where possible.</p>\n</blockquote>",
