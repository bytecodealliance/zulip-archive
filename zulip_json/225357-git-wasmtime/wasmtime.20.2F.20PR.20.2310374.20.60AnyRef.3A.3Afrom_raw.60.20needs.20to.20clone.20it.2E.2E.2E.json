Then, if we don't clone in <code>from_raw</code>, when a GC is triggered, the DRC collector will see that Wasm isn't holding the ref alive anymore and will decref (and perhaps even deallocate) it, which leaves the <code>AnyRef</code> we constructed via <code>from_raw</code> dangling.</p>\n<p>Fixes #10182</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
