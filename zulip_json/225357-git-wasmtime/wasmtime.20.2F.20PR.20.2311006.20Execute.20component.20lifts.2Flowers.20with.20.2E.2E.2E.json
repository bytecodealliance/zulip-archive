With the advent of Pulley, however, this has changed! We already have a test that's run specifically on CI which precompiles a wasm module on the host and then uses the <code>*.cwasm</code> in Miri, so this does the same for components.</p>\n<p>This adds a new test which instantiates a component and then runs lifts/lowers for some basic types with the static and dynamic host APIs. This is intended to weed out a large class of possible soundness issues but doesn't touch on all the unsafe code that we have at this time. Nevertheless there's a lot more run through Miri than before and a few minor locations were fixed up as a result. The hope is that this can serve as a basis for extending the set of component tests in Miri over time.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
