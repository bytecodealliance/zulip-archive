Unfortunately though this is probably not a great issue to tackle for you at this time. This is mostly a note to us working on the cm-async bits to come back to this and revisit it. We have some other planned refactorings which may make this issue less relevant, and otherwise the exact shape of a solution for this issue is uncertain. We want to be careful about crate or CI organization so this isn't a great issue to jump in on unfortunately.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Your perspective on project priorities—and any watch-outs I should keep in mind—would help me choose work that adds real value while staying out of the way.</p>\n<p>I appreciate any direction you can offer and am, of course, happy to handle the scoping, tests, documentation, and follow-up reviews.</p>\n<p>Thanks again for your time and mentorship.</p>\n<p>Best regards,<br>\nShashi Shankar</p>\n</blockquote>",
