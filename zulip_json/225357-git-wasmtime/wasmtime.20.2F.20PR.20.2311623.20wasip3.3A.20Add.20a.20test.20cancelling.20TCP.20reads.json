It then waits for readiness via a 0-length read and retries again. The test is intended to assert that the number of consecutive zero-length reads reported is capped at some small number (e.g. this shouldn't infinite loop).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
