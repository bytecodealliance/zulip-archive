Specifically, cancelling a subtask that was in a <code>starting</code> state turned it into a zombie that never exited, meaning <code>TaskExit::block</code> would block forever without making progress.</p>\n<p>This commit properly disposes of the subtask's thread and sets its <code>exited</code> field to <code>true</code>, which allows <code>subtask_drop</code> to delete it entirely. Additionally, I've updated <code>test_cancel</code> to call <code>TaskExit::block</code> to ensure this does not regress.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
