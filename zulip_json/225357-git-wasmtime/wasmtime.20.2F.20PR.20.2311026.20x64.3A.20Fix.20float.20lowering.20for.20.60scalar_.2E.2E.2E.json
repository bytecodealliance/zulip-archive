The semantics of the CLIF <code>scalar_to_vector</code> instruction is that the upper bits are zeroed in the resulting vector but Cranelift otherwise leaves the upper bits of registers undefined. This means that a float scalar to vector must actively zero the upper bits rather than leave the preserved.</p>\n<p>Closes #11024</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
