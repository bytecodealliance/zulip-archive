However this is only large enough for r6-r15, the callee-saves in the standard ABI.</p>\n<p>The implementation implicitly assumed this, and when I adjusted the definition of clobbered registers for the <code>patchable</code> ABI, stating that r0-r15 are clobbered instead, the code happily generated a store-multiple (<code>stmg</code>) instruction that saved too much data in too little space, overwriting other bits of the stack.</p>\n<p>Also, the clobber-save/restore sequence code only saved the bottom 64 bits of clobbered vector/float registers (which are 128 bits), implicitly encoding the fact that the SysV ABI specifies only the bottom half as callee-saved.</p>\n<p>This PR implements <code>patchable</code> properly on s390x by open-coding the sequences to save all vector registers and r0-r5 in the explicit clobber-save area (still using the SysV-defined one for r6-r15).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Thanks for the review!</p>\n<p>I've updated to use <code>STMG</code> / <code>LMG</code>; opting not to try to add vector store/load multiple for now since the encoding isn't there but we can do that as followup if needed. (As we discussed in the Cranelift weekly, this isn't too performance-critical on the callee side; in Wasmtime, at least, the save/restore sequence will execute only when hitting a breakpoint.)</p>\n</blockquote>",
