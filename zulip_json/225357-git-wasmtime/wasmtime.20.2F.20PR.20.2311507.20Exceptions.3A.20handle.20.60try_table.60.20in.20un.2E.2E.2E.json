This PR fixes that by updating <code>try_table</code> handling to work like <code>block</code> and <code>loop</code> in unreachable contexts.</p>\n<p>Fixes #11505.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
