Guards are added to ensure that the shift amounts are both greater than zero.</p>\n<p>This in theory shouldn't have much practical impact since shift-by-zero and shift-by-type-width are both optimized away in the mid-end. That means that this is only possible to expose with opt-level=0 which may help explain why this went undiscovered for ~1 year.</p>\n<p>Closes #12318</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
