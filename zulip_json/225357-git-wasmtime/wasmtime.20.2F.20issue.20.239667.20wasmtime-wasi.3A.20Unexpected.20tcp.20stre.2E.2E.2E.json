Now that I've read over this and <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9691\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9691</a> I personally don't think there's a bug in the wasmtime-wasi implementation here.

Here after the initial \"Hi!\" message is ready it's not actually known whether the stream is readable or not. Determining this would involve actually consulting the kernel with some sort of syscall or something like that. It's a pretty important perf optimization that in async servers you don't do anything with the kernel until absolutely necessary.</p>\n<p>For example here the kernel was consulted during the first <code>server.input.subscribe().block()</code>. At this point the stream is considered readable. The issued <code>read</code> then again consults the kernel and reads out <code>\"Hi!\"</code>.  At this point though the stream is notably considered still readable by Tokio and Wasmtime. It's not known whether this was a \"short read\" or whether more data is coming soon. This is why the next <code>subscribe()</code> immediately says \"yes this is readable\". Doing otherwise would require unnecessarily consulting the kernel.</p>\n<p>Working robustly with async is certainly an art but personally I don't think that there's a bug here that needs fixing. I would personally think we can close <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9691\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/9691</a> and this issue as \"working as intended\".</p>\n</blockquote>",

I started a new job and have a whole host of new problems to work on, so I dropped some of the old ones.</p>\n<p>Thanks Alex for digging into this and helping me understand why the existing behavior is there. My conclusion is that my specification of \"a ready pollable implies <a href=\"http://input-stream.read\">input-stream.read</a> will succeed\" is too strong of a guarantee to implement efficiently on top of POSIX. In discussion with Alex, he suggested that only the behavior of read shows whether input was ready or not, and the pollable's readiness is a best-effort indicator that provides an optimization over busy-looping on read. I expect that we can easily accommodate the weakening of that guarantee in existing code (at least in wstd), and any existing binaries can't possibly be relying on that guarantee since its never been upheld by implementations. We will have to take that discussion out to the spec repo in order to nail it all down.</p>\n</blockquote>",
