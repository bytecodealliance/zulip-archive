We also have a <code>wast_tests</code> fuzzer, however, which configures even more knobs and run tests under these configurations. In the interest of saving time on CI and avoiding too much combinatorial explosion this commit changes the <code>wast</code> test suite to avoiding combinatorics and instead running in only \"interesting\" combinations.</p>\n<p>The goal here is to weed out common issues on CI quickly, such as compiler-specific behaviors, but leave the full spectrum of combinatorial tests to fuzzing. For example we probably aren't getting much extra coverage running Winch with the pooling allocator over running Cranelift with the pooling allocator.</p>\n<p>This reduces the number of tests from ~4500 to ~2500 which should hopefully lead to some minor improvements in CI time.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
