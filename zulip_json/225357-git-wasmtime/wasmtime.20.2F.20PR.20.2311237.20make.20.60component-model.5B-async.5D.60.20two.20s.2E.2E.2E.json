I traced it down to the <code>wast</code> crate, which was enabling <code>wasmtime/component-model-async</code> whenever the <code>component-model</code> feature was enabled.  This commit separates them into distinct features.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
