Specifically what happened was:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Invocation of WebAssembly went through <code>VMFuncRef::array_call</code> which takes a <code>&amp;self</code> parameter.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Inside of WebAssembly though a <code>ref.func</code> instruction, or anything else that references the original exported function, will re-initialize the <code>VMFuncRef</code> which writes the <code>&amp;self</code> up the stack, which is not sound.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fixing this required changing the signature of <code>array_call</code> from <code>&amp;self</code> to <code>me: NonNull&lt;VMFuncRef&gt;</code>, and the signature was already <code>unsafe</code> so this is a new unsafe contract for that signature.</p>\n<p>In fixing this, however, it was discovered that a mistake was made in #10943 where some internal functions for re-initializing a <code>VMFuncRef</code> relied on the previous signature of <code>&amp;mut self</code> but that PR switche to <code>&amp;self</code>. This PR corrects these signatures to <code>Pin&lt;&amp;mut Self&gt;</code> and then plumbs around the necessary changes, notably causing some refactoring in component-related bits.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
