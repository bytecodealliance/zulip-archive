One alternative to adding this would be to have <code>is_imm8</code> examine the more general <code>RegMemImm</code> instead, but this would mean the constructor types would have to change. Thoughts?</p>\n</blockquote>",

All the various helpers seem to be using <code>mask_xmm_shift</code> and the current lowerings could dispatch to a helper taking the <code>RegMemImm</code> result of <code>mask_xmm_shift</code> which handles the <code>*Imm</code> case to delegate to different constructors than when in the <code>Reg</code> or <code>Mem</code> case?</p>\n</blockquote>",
