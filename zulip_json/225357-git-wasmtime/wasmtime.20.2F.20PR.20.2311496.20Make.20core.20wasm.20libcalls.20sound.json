This is required to make them sound because otherwise it's possible to, in safe Rust, acquire two mutable pointers to the same instance. Implementing this change is made possible by the many many previous refactors to how all of these internals work. All that was required here was changing type signatures and minor updates to the order of operations inside of libcalls.</p>\n<p>Closes #11178</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
