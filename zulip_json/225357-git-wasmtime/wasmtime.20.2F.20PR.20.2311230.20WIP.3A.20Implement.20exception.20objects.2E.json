It does <em>not</em> yet tie this into any exception-throwing or -catching instructions (<code>throw</code>, <code>throw_ref</code>, <code>try_table</code>); that will come next.</p>\n<p>The design is a little fiddly because the type system has a nominal aspect to it: tags are <em>per-instance</em> entities and exceptions are associated with tags. The stack-switching work already added support for tags analogously to other instance entities (memories, tables, etc.). But, notably, because they are a runtime concept, they are not types per-se. Their signatures are, though, and <code>TagType</code> is a thin wrapper around <code>FuncType</code> as a result. The Wasm proposal does not define any concrete type definitions for exception objects in the lattice, only providing top (<code>exnref</code> / <code>(ref null exn)</code>) and bottom (<code>nullexnref</code> / <code>(ref null noexn)</code>) types. In order to align with the way the rest of the GC system works, I've opted to define our own notion of structural types at the host API and type-interning layer built around the signatures; so all Wasm exception objects with the same func-type / signature are the same \"type\" as far as GC is concerned. The objects of that type are then associated with particular tag instances via runtime fields. In essence we are refining the Wasm types further to allow our implementation to precompute things (i.e., layouts); this is fine because this refinement is not exposed to Wasm.</p>\n<p>I'm posting this as a draft to get any early feedback that might exist but I'll plan to add more tests next week before building on this!</p>\n</blockquote>",

An exnref would then be more like an externref; maybe held as an <code>Option&lt;Box&lt;Exception&gt;&gt;</code> in a table on the <code>Store</code> or something like that. In the end I didn't like that for three main reasons: (i) exception objects can store GC refs as payload, so when both are enabled, one needs special handling anyway to trace edges in both directions; (ii) it's quite a lot of duplicated effort (computing how to lay out values in a struct-like container, handling layouts and interning them, etc.); (iii) if one addresses problem (i) by having a separate exnref implementation for with-GC and without-GC, then one has two code paths to test and that's awful. Plus in practice most users of exceptions will likely want GC too. (Perhaps with the exception of a setjmp/longjmp use-case in wasi-libc?) Or to summarize all the above: GC has enough overlap with exceptions that they just need to interact, so we might as well handle them with common bits.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a small aside, it's a bit regrettable how much duplication in a sense there is necessary for this.

In particular one could imagine either using more dynamism internally (having a \"struct or exception layout\" that knows its kind dynamically and has the appropriate dynamic checks) or using traits or macros to factor out method implementations. In the end the surface bits needed to be separate for clean typesafe API reasons and the rest kind of fell out of that.

It's wordy, but easy to read and verify it's right. The downside is that if it's got a bug (which would likely be preexisting if any) there's a lot of places to chase down.
