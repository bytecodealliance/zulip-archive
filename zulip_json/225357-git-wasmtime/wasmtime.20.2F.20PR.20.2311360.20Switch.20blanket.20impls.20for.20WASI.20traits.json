This is intended to make future integration with wasi-http easier where wasi-http will take a few specific proposals (e.g. not <code>WasiFilesystemView</code>) but implementing <code>WasiView</code> for a contexet will still be sufficient (as opposed to requiring multiple implementations of separate traits).</p>\n<p>The original use case of forwarding impls has more-or-less been refactored away at this point so I don't think it's as critical to preserve them.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
