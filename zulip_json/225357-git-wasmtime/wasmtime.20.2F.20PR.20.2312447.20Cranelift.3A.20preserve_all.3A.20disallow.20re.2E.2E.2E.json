But the complexity doesn't seem worthwhile, and this path is not actually needed at the moment.</p>\n<p>Thinking more broadly, anyone using <code>preserve_all</code> for hooks meant to minimally perturb register state will likely not want to use many return values anyway (that defeats the point). We could allow <em>one</em> return value, with the knowledge that this always fits in a register in our existing ABIs, but that also feels somewhat arbitrary, and I could make the argument that \"preserve all\" should really mean preserve <em>all</em>. Someone wanting to return a value anyway from such a hook could use indirect means (pass in a pointer to a stackslot, for example). I'm happy to tweak this limit if others have more thoughts, however.</p>\n<p>Fixes #12399.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
