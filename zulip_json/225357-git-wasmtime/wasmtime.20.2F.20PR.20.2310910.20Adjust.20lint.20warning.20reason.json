This is indeed dead code but it's required due to how we use macros/generated code/etc, so just suppress the warning for now.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
