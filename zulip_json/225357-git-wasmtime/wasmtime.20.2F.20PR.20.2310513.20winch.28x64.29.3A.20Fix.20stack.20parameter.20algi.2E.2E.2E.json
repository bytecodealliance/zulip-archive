With the introduction of vector types, namely, v128, we must ensure that arguments greater than 8 bytes in size are correctly type-sized aligned.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
