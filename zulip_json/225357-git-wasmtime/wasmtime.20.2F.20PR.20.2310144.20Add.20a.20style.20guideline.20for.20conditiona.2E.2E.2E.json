I've personally got opinions about how to structure everything as well, and these opinions are not always obvious to others or discerned from just reading snippets. To assist with this I figured it would be nice to have a style guideline for Wasmtime's conditionally compiled code explaining at least at a high level what's going on and some rough basic principles.</p>\n<p>I've attempted to give this a stab and have added a page to the contributing documentation about the style guidelines for conditional compilation. I'm sure I've forgotten something here but my hope is that we can evolve this over time.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
