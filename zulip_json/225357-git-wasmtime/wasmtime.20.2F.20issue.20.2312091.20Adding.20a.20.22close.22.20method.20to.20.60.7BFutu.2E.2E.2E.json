Currently this is only detect-able via <code>Drop for MyThing</code> which works well enough, but I was wondering if it would be viable to add a <code>fn close(...)</code> method on the traits? The trait method would take a <code>StoreContextMut&lt;D&gt;</code> which would enable updating store state on close which would be convenient. Is this easy enough to slot in to the implementation?</p>\n</blockquote>",
