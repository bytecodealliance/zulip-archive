This involved purging the <code>self.abi</code> field and updating all callers as appropriate.</p>\n<p>This then performed some small refactoring to use <code>TrampolineCompiler</code> for compiler intrinsics. Unsafe intrinsics also now have the same strategy of calling the wasm ABI trampoline when compiling for the array ABI. This should ensure that all entry trampolines are going through the same function.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

One reason is that cranelift inlining doesn't support <code>get_exception_handler_address</code> but even if it did we couldn't properly inline in entry trampolines because we wouldn't have the right handler recorded at all call points. To handle that I disabled inlining into these callers no matter what. </p>\n<p>My thinking is that these aren't perf-sensitive and if they are we need to figure something else out other than inlining.</p>\n</blockquote>",
