It is a mirror of the runtime-side types, but is simpler as it doesn't track precise GC types. We'll need to plumb through <code>ModuleInternedTypeIndex</code>es and then translate those via the type registry at runtime to support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mutation, because we need to check that an updated value for a local/stack slot is of a compatible type</li>\n<li>An API that allows querying the precise type of the slot at runtime</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
