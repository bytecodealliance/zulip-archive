This means that an ASAN build of doc tests would use 1 CGU with no optimizations. Locally this balooned the doc tests for <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> to a whopping 16G of memory in one process locally. This was found in the wasip3-prototyping repository where more doc tests were added.</p>\n<p>This commit, for ASAN builds, updates the opt-level and codegen-units settings used for rustdoc. This gets the LLVM memory usage under control to avoid OOM-ing the github actions runner we're running on.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
