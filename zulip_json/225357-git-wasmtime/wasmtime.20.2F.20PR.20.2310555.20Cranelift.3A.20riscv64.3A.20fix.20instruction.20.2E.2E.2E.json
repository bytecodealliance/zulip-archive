We made use of the existing island mechanism (now presented as a new pseudoinst as in aarch64, rather than as ad-hoc emission code) to ensure that we meet label-reference-distance deadlines. Unfortunately we didn't update the debug-assert that checks instructions for worst-case size to exclude calls (and the new <code>EmitIsland</code> pseudoinst), since they handle islanding separately.</p>\n<p>Found via fuzzbug at [1].</p>\n<p>[1]: <a href=\"https://oss-fuzz.com/testcase-detail/4819793142415360\">https://oss-fuzz.com/testcase-detail/4819793142415360</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
