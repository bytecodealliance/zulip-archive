For <code>pwsh</code> I think that's fine to ignore. I think it works on Linux since it's distinct from <code>powershell</code> which, as far as I know, is Windows-only. The reason we're using <code>pwsh</code> though has everything to do with mingw though and nothing to do with other platforms. It's just some really minor duplication in the CI config. (I don't actually know what <code>pwsh</code> vs <code>powershell</code> is myself, it just happened to work when I was fixing mingw awhile back)</p>\n</blockquote>",
