This lint will be warn-by-default in the 2024 edition so this is intended to smooth the future migration to the new edition.</p>\n<p>Many <code>unsafe</code> blocks were added in places the lint warned about, with two major exceptions. The <code>wasmtime</code> and <code>wasmtime-c-api</code> crates simply expect this lint to fire and effectively disable the lint. They're too big at this time to do through this PR. My hope is that one day in the future they'll be migrated, but more realistically that probably won't happen so these crates just won't benefit from this lint.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
