Instead of using Tokio's primitives use the <code>std::io</code> primitives which will block the current program while the output is produced. This matches WASIp2 semantics and we always have the option of making this more async in the future (or even have it as a runtime flag). This avoids the need to call <code>poll_flush</code> in stdio unconditionally in the <code>wasi:cli</code> implementation which didn't feel quite right.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
