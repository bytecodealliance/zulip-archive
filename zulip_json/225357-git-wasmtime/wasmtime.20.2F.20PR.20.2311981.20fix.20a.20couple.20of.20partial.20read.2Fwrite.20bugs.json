However, once we've delivered the event regarding the partial operation, we need to set the state back to <code>Open</code>, since we'll have released the buffer back to the guest at that point.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
