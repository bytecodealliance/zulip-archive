Support is added for the <code>load</code>, <code>store</code>, <code>bitcast</code>, <code>f16const</code> and <code>f128const</code> CLIF instructions.</p>\n<p>Note that the <a href=\"https://github.com/IBM/s390x-abi/releases\">s390x ABI specification</a> currently does not specify the ABI for <code>f16</code>. However, Clang recently added support for <code>f16</code> in <a href=\"https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/109164\">https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/109164</a> (as opposed to LLVM just supporting it at the LLVM IR level) using a straightforward extrapolation of the ABI (passing <code>f16</code> in floating point registers just like <code>f32</code> and <code>f64</code>), so on that basis I've not put the <code>f16</code> ABI behind the <code>enable_llvm_abi_extensions</code> setting.</p>\n<p><code>f16</code>/<code>f128</code> issue: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8312\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/8312</a></p>\n</blockquote>",

For f128, current hardware actually has two different ways of representing them - there's the \"traditional\" way of splitting an f128 value across a pair of 64-bit floating-point registers, but since z14 we can also hold f128 values in a single vector register, with a full set of arithmetic operations available.</p>\n<p>This patch is based on the traditional FPR pair approach, but I would much prefer using single vector registers, for several reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>z14 is the minimum architecture level for cranelift, so the VR-based instructions are always available</li>\n<li>Handling a single VR is much simpler than handling a pair of FPRs</li>\n<li>Specifically, while your patch hasn't run into this problem yet, once you actually want to use any of the traditional f128 arithmetic instructions, those only operate on architected <em>pairs</em> (N, N+2), not any two random FPRs.  But the cranelift regalloc actually isn't capable of allocating pairs, so those would have to be hardcoded everywhere</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the one place where we'd still require pairs (even when using VRs everywhere else) is for function arguments and returns, as the ABI was defined for older systems.   But for the ABI we have to hard-code registers anyway, so that should be much less of an issue.  (For our own non-system ABIs, we could even chose to pass f128 in VR as well.)</p>\n<p>LLVM (and GCC) will also use VRs to hold f128 if you build with -march=z14 or higher.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
