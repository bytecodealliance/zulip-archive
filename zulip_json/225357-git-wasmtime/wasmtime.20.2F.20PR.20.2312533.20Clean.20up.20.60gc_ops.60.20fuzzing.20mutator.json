This should make things a bit easier to read and edit and plays nicer with LSP.</li>\n<li>A bunch of GC op filtering that was logically part of fixing up an instruction is now actually part of <code>GcOp::fixup</code>. Also a redundant <code>op.fixup()</code> call was removed, <code>GcOp::fixup</code> takes <code>&amp;self</code> instead of <code>&amp;mut self</code> since it returns a new <code>GcOp</code> now instead of mutatint <code>self</code> in place, etc...</li>\n<li>A few other small things here and there.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>+cc @khagankhan @eeide </p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
