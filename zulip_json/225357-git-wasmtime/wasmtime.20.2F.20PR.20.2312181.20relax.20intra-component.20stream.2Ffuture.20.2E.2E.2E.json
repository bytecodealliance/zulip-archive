Previously, it trapped because it tried to do an intra-component read/write on a <code>stream&lt;u8&gt;</code>.  Now that that's allowed, it instead traps when doing an intra-component read/write on a <code>future&lt;result&lt;option&lt;trailers&gt;, error-code&gt;&gt;</code>, which is still prohibited.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
