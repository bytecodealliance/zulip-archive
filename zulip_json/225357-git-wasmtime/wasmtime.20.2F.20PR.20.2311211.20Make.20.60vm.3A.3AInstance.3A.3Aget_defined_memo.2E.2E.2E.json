Notably the <code>get_defined_memory</code> helper now returns a safe mutable reference instead of a raw pointer. This is then additionally coupled with the canonicalization of always working with memories as \"instance plus defined memory index\" instead of \"instance plus memory index\". This enables removing some unsafe <code>VMContext</code> to <code>Instance</code> conversion as well. This change, however, required updating libcalls to special-case when an imported memory is operated on to load the vmcontext/index in the libcall itself.</p>\n<p>This change notably does not update the <code>memory_init</code> libcall just yet due to the fact that the <code>DataIndex</code> is relative to the owning instance even if the memory is owned by a different instance (e.g. it's imported). Otherwise this chips away at some of the <code>unsafe</code> related to memory/table management in <code>vm::Instance</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
