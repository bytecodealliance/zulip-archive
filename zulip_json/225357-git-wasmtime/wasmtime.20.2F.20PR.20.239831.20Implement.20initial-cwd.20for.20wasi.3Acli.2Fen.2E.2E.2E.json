The issue you linked is from a long time ago and was intended for <code>*.witx</code> or effectively WASIp1. WASIp1 isn't going to change any more but this function was added to enhance the functionality and largely solve that issue in WASIp2.</p>\n<p>To the extent the function exists, however, I'm also not familar with any integration with it. For example <code>wasi-libc</code> does not call the function and try to use the return value (nor does Rust's libstd). Hooking it up to Wasmtime, however, is step 1 in filling out ecosystem support for it though as otherwise it can't even be tested.</p>\n</blockquote>",
