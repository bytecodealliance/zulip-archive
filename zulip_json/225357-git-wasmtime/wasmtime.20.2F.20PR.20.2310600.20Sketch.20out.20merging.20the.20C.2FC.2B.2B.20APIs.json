Externally it was all entirely a single file, but naturally this isn't great for evolution as it's just one giant tangled header. Instead this commit sketches out a possible different path forward which is to provide the C++ API as a sibling to the C API in preexisting header files. For example this moves the <code>Error</code> class to the <code>error.h</code> header file as an example.</p>\n<p>My rough hope would be that in the long-term we could deprecate/remove the <code>wasmtime.hh</code> header file and instead \"just\" have all the C++ APIs in the normal header files (e.g. <code>wasmtime.h</code>). Additionally the split of the C API in separate header files would be amenable to a similar split of the C++ API too where the API you see is basically conditional on the language mode of whatever's including the headers.</p>\n<p>I'll note though I've not seen prior art in doing this. I'm not aware of any other project which exports both a C and C++ API in its header files. That being said I'm not sure how many other projects would fall in such a bucket.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
