This allowed optimization of, for example, <code>(((x == 0) == 0) == 0 ...)</code> to a single level, either <code>x == 0</code> or <code>x != 0</code> depending on even/odd nesting depth.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately this kind of recursion in the backend has a depth bounded only by the user input, hence creates a DoS vulnerability: the wrong kind of compiler input can cause a stack overflow in Cranelift at compilation time. This case is reachable from Wasmtime's Wasm frontend via the <code>i32.eqz</code> operator (for example) as well.</p>\n<p>Ideally, this kind of deep rewrite is best done in our mid-end optimizer, where we think carefully about bounds for recursive rewrites. The left-hand sides for the backend rules should really be fixed shapes that correspond to machine instructions, rather than ad-hoc peephole optimizations in their own right.</p>\n<p>This fix thus simply removes the recursion case that causes the blowup. The patch includes two tests: one with optimizations disabled, showing correct compilation (without the fix, this case fails to compile with a stack overflow), and one with optimizations enabled, showing that the mid-end properly cleans up the nested expression and we get the expected one-level result anyway.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Preserve codegen on branches.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This change works by splitting a rule so that the entry point used by <code>brif</code> lowering can still peel off one layer of <code>icmp</code> and emit it directly, without entering the unbounded structural recursion.</p>\n<p>It also adds a mid-end rule to catch one case that we were previously catching in the backend only: <code>fcmp(...) != 0</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
