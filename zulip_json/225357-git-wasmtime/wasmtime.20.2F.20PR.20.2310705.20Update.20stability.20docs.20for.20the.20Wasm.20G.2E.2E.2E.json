We only do subtype checks as a fallback when direct equality fails, and for non-GC-using Wasm if direct equality fails then a trap is raised and the program terminates so a subtype check on this branch doesn't matter. When direct equality succeeds, then there is no overhead compared to when the GC proposal is not enabled.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
