SSE instructions expect 128-bit aligned loads when using the <code>m128</code> operand and fault if that is not the case. This had been fixed previously by disallowing load-sinking for <code>XmmMem</code> ([#4891]) but more recently we had adopted the use of <code>XmmMemAligned</code> in <code>cranelift-codegen</code>. Since [#10316] had no knowledge of <code>XmmMemAligned</code> (only <code>XmmMem</code>), it caused the same kind fault--an OOB trap that was in fact an unaligned load.</p>\n<p>Why didn't CI catch this? Since all the CI machines have AVX and we do not explicitly test the SSE-only case, these unaligned, sunk loads would use the AVX lowering in CI. AVX loads handle unaligned accesses without a fault. This was only discovered during fuzzing when AVX was disabled (i.e., <code>--target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</code>).</p>\n<p>To fix this, this change adopts the <code>XmmMemAligned</code> type in the generated assembler code. This is temporary, though: a more lasting fix should pass along an \"alignment required\" bit from the assembler AST. In the meantime, this closes #10408.</p>\n<p>[#10408]: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/10408\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/10408</a><br>\n[#4891]: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4891\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/4891</a><br>\n[#10316]: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10316\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10316</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
