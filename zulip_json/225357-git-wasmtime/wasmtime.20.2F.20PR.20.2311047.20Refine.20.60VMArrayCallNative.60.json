The first two parameters of this function are the callee/caller VMContext values but they are both ascribed as <code>VMOpaqueContext</code>. This is because for the <code>callee</code> it's not known exactly what type the pointer has except within the context of the defining function, so this value was not changed.</p>\n<p>For the <code>caller</code> parameter though it's always the case that the value passed in is indeed a <code>VMContext</code>. This commit reflects this fact in the type signature and removes a number of now-unnecessary casts.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
