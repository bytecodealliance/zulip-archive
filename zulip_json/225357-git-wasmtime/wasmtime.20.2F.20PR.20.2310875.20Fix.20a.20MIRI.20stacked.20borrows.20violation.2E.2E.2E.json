This has to do with recursively calling WebAssembly and juggling the various bits of mutable state associated with the Pulley VM. I don't believe that this is a soundness issue in the sense of miscompiles, but it's nevertheless something good to fix.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
