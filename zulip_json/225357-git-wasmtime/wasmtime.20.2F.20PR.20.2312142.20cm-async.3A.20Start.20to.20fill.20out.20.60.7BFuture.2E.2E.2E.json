These are intended to behave similarly to <code>ResourceAny</code> where the embedder doesn't have static knowledge ahead of time about the type of the future/stream in use. Changes made here are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>ComponentType for {Stream,Future}Reader&lt;T&gt;</code> now correctly typecheck the <code>T</code>.</li>\n<li>Conversion to/from <code>*Any</code> types now properly typechecks the payload type against the expected type.</li>\n<li><code>{Future,Stream}Any</code> now live in their own file with the matrix of conversions to the typed variants.</li>\n<li>A <code>close</code> method was added to <code>*Any</code> types.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These types are not currently directly constructible but this will likely be relaxed in the future. Additionally the host can't actually use these values without knowing the type, which is another restriction that will be relaxed in the future (aka implemented).</p>\n<p>cc #11161</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
