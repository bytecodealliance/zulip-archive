In particular, this is because the call{1,2,3,4} instructions are <em>not</em> marked as clobbering x0/x1/x2/x3 explicitly.</p>\n<p>To fix this issue, this PR simply omits the magical folding that happens in the emission code. An alternative would be to try to add the clobbers to the special instructions, but actually we don't want these to be just \"clobbers\": we want the usual regalloc constraints to take effect and the values to be represented as continuing valid/live in the registers after return, and the proper way to do that is to leave the <code>args</code> on the call and let the regalloc operand pass add the fixed-reg operands.</p>\n<p>Discovered while trying to land #12183.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
