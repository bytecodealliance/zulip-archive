It is possible that we can introduce some shared abstraction, which could be reused by both (future) <code>WasiP3Ctx</code> and <code>WasiP2Ctx</code>, but for now I've just moved the context into <code>p2</code> submodule, since I think we will <em>always</em> have a wasip{N}-specific <code>WasiP{N}Ctx</code>, particularly because set of interfaces included in WASI, as well as their semantics, might change across versions</p>\n<p>I've added 3 more commits on top of the move, which seemed to make sense for consistency:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>rename <code>WasiCtx</code> -&gt; <code>WasiP2Ctx</code></li>\n<li>rename <code>WasiView</code> -&gt; <code>WasiP2View</code></li>\n<li>rename <code>WasiImpl</code> -&gt; <code>WasiP2Impl</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>I opted not to rename existing <code>preview1</code> and <code>preview0</code> modules/features to avoid breaking changes.<br>\ncc @pchickey </p>\n</blockquote>",

That being said could you try renaming <code>src/filesystem.rs</code> to something like <code>src/fs.rs</code>? That might tip heuristics the other direction to see the rename here. I think the issue is that some of <code>src/filesystem.rs</code> was retained while most was moved here, and by having the original copy still preserved it might be confusing the rename detection.</p>\n<p>We could then follow-up with a commit to rename <code>src/fs.rs</code> to <code>src/filesystem.rs</code> if we really wanted too which I think would fixup the git history here.</p>\n</blockquote>",
