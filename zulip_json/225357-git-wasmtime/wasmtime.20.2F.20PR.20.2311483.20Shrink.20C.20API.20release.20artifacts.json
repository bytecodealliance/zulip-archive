Some testing in #11475 of using full LTO or only building Linux/macOS with 1 CGU shows that this'll likely increase cycle time by ~1 minute. Windows builders are already the slowest release build builders and this is adding 1 minute using 1 CGU vs 2-3 extra minutes for full LTO. Linux/macOS are switched to using full LTO which the CI builders currently have plenty of time for.</p>\n<p>This shaves 50M off the C API artifacts for Linux which buys a good amount of headroom for future changes.</p>\n<p>Closes #11476</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
