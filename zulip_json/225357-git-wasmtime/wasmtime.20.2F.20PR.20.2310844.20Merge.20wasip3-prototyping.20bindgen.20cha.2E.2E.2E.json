This is<br>\ndone to make the future merge with <code>wasip3-prototyping</code> smaller<br>\ncomplexity-wise.</p>\n<p>This is intended to be a no-functional-change for non-\"concurrent\"<br>\nimports, or those for component model async. That means that it's<br>\nintended that no current embedding is affected by these changes.<br>\nInternally though there has been restructuring.</p>\n<p>Namely internally the generation of an interface trait, a resource<br>\ntrait, and a world trait are all unified in a single method now. In the<br>\nfuture with component model async these traits are being split into<br>\nasync/sync versions and so it was much nicer to do this in one location<br>\nrather than across three different locations.</p>\n<p>This required some minor renamings in the generated code and moving<br>\naround some impls, but otherwise the generated code should mostly be the<br>\nsame as before (see golden output diff in the subsequent commit of this<br>\nPR)</p>\n</blockquote>",

That would give us _some_ test coverage for the <code>concurrent_imports: true</code> and <code>concurrent_exports: true</code> cases.</p>\n<p>BTW, I just noticed that code is commented-out in the <code>wasip3-prototyping</code> repo also.
