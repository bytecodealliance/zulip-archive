Previously the cmake scripts would copy all wasmtime headers into the build directory to live adjacent to the <code>conf.h</code>-generated header. This meant that there was only one <code>-I</code> directory, for example, but it meant that changes to the source files after configuration weren't reflected in the output. This commit fixes this by leaving the source headers in-place. This means that there are now two include directories during building.</p>\n<p>Various rules/targets should all be updated to handle this, and notably the build script of the C API still copies headers around as it did before (when built via Rust).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
