This means that we can't actually have true optional dependencies per-backend, so the only solution here is to unconditionally depend on <code>cranelift-assembler-x64</code>. That being said it's a pretty small crate that's not too hard to build so I also don't think that's an issue.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I could go either way on <code>Inst::external</code>, and another way to shorten things would be to use <code>inst::foo</code> instead of <code>asm::inst::foo</code>? Or perhaps <code>trait EmitExt { .. }</code> just to give an <code>emit</code> method?</p>\n<p>For immediates I still think that one option we could do is, just before emission, to \"compress\" the immediate. For example <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/28e26fdf7e389148c5725a58f0627693c525b170/cranelift/codegen/src/isa/x64/inst/emit.rs#L4681-L4695\">here</a> we could match on a arithmetic instructions like add/sub which use the 32-bit immediate form and optionally compress them to the 8-bit form. I don't think that would have any meaningful impact on compile time, wouldn't affect any semantics, and would avoid the need to do this everywhere. Alternatively having <code>Inst::addq_mi</code> as a helper I also think would be reasonable where it's still a wrapper around the assembler but an even thinner wrapper around the assembler than the one that previously took <code>RegMemImm</code> and only does immediate-checking.</p>\n<p>I also think it'd be reasonable to refactor the assembler to use raw Rust types instead of <code>asm::{Si,I}mm</code> types too to assist with verbosity.</p>\n<p>Near-term what about the <code>impl Into&lt;...&gt;</code> plus op-with-immediate helpers on <code>Inst</code>? Longer-term could consider something like the mutate-the-instruction-just-before-emit or something like that.</p>\n</blockquote>",
