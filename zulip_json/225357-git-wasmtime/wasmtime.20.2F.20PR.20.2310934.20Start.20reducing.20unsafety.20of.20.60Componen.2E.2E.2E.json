One major thrust that's manifested in is the removal of the usage of <code>*mut ComponentInstance</code> where possible and instead using an index to safely borrow from the store to get the entire instance. This commit does not fully realize this vision just yet but lays some groundwork leading up to this.</p>\n<p>This commit specifically removes the <code>*mut ComponentInstance</code> pointers in lift/lower contexts in favor of directly storing a <code>wasmtime::component::Instance</code>. When the raw <code>ComponentInstance</code> is needed it's acquired from the <code>StoreOpaque</code> in a safe fashion that borrows the entire store for the duration of the returned borrow. This in turn required pushing instances into the store earlier during instantiation because during instantiation an instance could call out to host APIs which do lifts/lowers.</p>\n<p>There's still more work to be done to plumb this fully into libcalls and host function invocations but I wanted to upstream the wasip3 work piecemeal a chunk at a time.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

It's just too damn useful to be able to get a safe <code>&amp;mut ComponentInstance</code> and too subtle to avoid trying to do so. I opened <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/10933\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/10933</a> to track a better solution here.</p>\n</blockquote>",
