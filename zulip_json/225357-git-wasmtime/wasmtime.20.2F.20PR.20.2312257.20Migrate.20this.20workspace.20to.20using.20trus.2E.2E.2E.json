Eventually we'll want the restriction that only <code>wasmtime-publish</code> is the user on all of our crates, but for now this needs to land and get backported before that's done.</p>\n<p>Changes here are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>publish-to-cratesio.yml</code> workflow now uses <code>rust-lang/crates-io-auth-action@v1</code> to get a crates.io-based token. The in-repository secret is no longer used.</li>\n<li>The <code>publish-to-cratesio.yml</code> workflow has a new github \"Environment\" it runs in named <code>publish</code></li>\n<li>The publish script no longer adds the <code>github:bytecodealliance:wasmtime-publish</code> user to crates.</li>\n<li>The publish script now verifies that the <code>wasmtime-publish</code> github users is on all crates.</li>\n<li>Eventually the publish script will verify that it's the only user on all the crates, but that's left for a future PR.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>External changes are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new <code>publish</code> \"Environment\" was added to this repository.</li>\n<li>All crates are configured on <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> to have a trusted publishing workflow for this repository.</li>\n<li>All crates now require being published through a trusted publishing workflow.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My plan is to backport this to the 40.0.0 branch, run a point release, fix anything that comes up, and then backport this to all supported branches of Wasmtime. Once that's all done and sorted I'll follow-up with more contributor-facing documentation about how to add new crates.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
