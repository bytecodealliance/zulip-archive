Additionally extracting a wasm trace from a <code>wasmtime_error_t</code> is added since traces happen on both traps and errors now.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--</p>\n<p>Please ensure that the following steps are all taken care of before submitting<br>\nthe PR.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This has been discussed in issue #..., or if not, please tell us why<br>\n  here.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] A short description of what this does, why it is needed; if the<br>\n  description becomes long, the matter should probably be discussed in an issue<br>\n  first.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] This PR contains test cases, if meaningful.</p>\n</li>\n<li>[ ] A reviewer from the core maintainer team has been assigned for this PR.<br>\n  If you don't know who could review this, please indicate so.

I'm trying to understand how to implement <code>proc_exit</code> in a custom C++ wasm host that uses the wasmtime C API. It seems there is no way to return a trap with an exit code from a host function. What am I missing? Thanks.</p>\n</blockquote>",
