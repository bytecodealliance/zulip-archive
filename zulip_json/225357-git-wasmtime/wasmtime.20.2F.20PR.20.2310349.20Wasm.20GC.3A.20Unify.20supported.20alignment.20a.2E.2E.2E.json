This could lead to bugs like the following sequence of events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>free list initially has a block 0x10..MAX</li>\n<li>alloc(size=16) -&gt; 0x10<ul>\n<li>free list now has one block: 0x20..MAX</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>alloc(size=16) -&gt; 0x20<ul>\n<li>free list now has one block: 0x30..MAX</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>dealloc(0x10, size=16)<ul>\n<li>this merges 0x10..0x20 into 0x30..MAX because the gap between 0x20 and 0x30 is smaller than the minimum block size</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>dealloc(0x20, size=16)<ul>\n<li>triggers overlapping blocks assertion failure!</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If we ensure that the minimum allocation size is a multiple of our supported alignment and we clamp requested allocations' sizes to at least the minimum block size, then we could avoid this.</p>\n<p>It is simpler, however, to unify our supported alignment and our minimum block size into the same value. This PR does that. No more need for multiple concepts which interact in subtle ways.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
