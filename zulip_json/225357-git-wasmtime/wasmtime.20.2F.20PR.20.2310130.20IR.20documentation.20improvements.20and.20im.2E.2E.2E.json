Other asserts with string were capitalised, I tried to match it, reads like:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">assertion</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"err\">`</span><span class=\"n\">left</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">==</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">right</span><span class=\"err\">`</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">failed</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nc\">Address</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">width</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">of</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"mi\">64</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">expected</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">got</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"kt\">i32</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">left</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nc\">types</span><span class=\"p\">::</span><span class=\"n\">I32</span>\n<span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">right</span><span class=\"p\">:</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nc\">types</span><span class=\"p\">::</span><span class=\"n\">I64</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Technically the type assignment and print isn't necessary, but I found it reads more clear than left and right only, though the fmt made it a multi-line :/ </p>\n<p>In c5f31de428e5f7bb0ea84a64a7e228c9ea9e7574 the size of the first and second argument is changed to 64 bits, as well as the <code>v3</code> and <code>v4</code>, which hold the offset into the array, I also added one sentence above it pointing at the pointer size is assumed to be 64 bits for the conversion of the function to IR. I did the changes manually, confirmed the changes do not trigger the debug assert and verified the created symbol does work to calculate an average.</p>\n<p>Meta suggestion: The PR template contains:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That should really be linked in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">CONTRIBUTING.md</a> as well, because I ended up looking at the commit history to figure out the commit message preference, only to discover that it'll be squashed anyway :D </p>\n</blockquote>",
