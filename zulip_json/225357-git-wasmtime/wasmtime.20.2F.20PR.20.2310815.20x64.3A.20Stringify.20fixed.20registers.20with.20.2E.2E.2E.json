That should help ensure that if a virtual register is being used in an instruction that'll get printed instead of the fixed value that should pop out after regalloc. Disassembly shouldn't change though after register allocation because the value of the register should match the fixed encoding.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
