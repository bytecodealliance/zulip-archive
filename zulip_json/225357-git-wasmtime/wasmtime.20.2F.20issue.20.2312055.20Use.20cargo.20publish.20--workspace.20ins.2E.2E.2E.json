It should also make publishing faster by publishing multiple crates at once and only waiting for the publish to be propagated when publishing a crate that has a just published crate as dependency.</p>\n<h4>Implementation</h4>\n<p>TODO: Do you have an implementation plan, and/or ideas for data structures or<br>\nalgorithms to use?</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<p>TODO: What are the alternative implementation approaches or alternative ways to<br>\nsolve the problem that this feature would solve? How do these alternatives<br>\ncompare to this proposal?<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

Inevitably publishes go wrong and being unable to restart a publish is a bit of a deal breaker.</li>\n<li>Over time we've packed a lot of other bits into <code>publish.rs</code>, such as verifying crates build from packaged sources, verifying everything has the right ownership, and automatically bumping versions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've no doubt that <code>publish --workspace</code> is faster, but it's not really the long poll in our publication process anyway, so I'm not too worried about it personally.</p>\n</blockquote>",
