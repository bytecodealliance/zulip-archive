First a new <code>Config::gc_support</code> option is added which is hooked up to the CLI as <code>-Wgc-support</code>. This option controls the wasmparser-internal <code>GC_TYPES</code> feature. Its default value, like before, is <code>cfg!(feature = \"gc\")</code> and additionally enabling it requires the <code>gc</code> crate feature to be enabled.</p>\n<p>This commit then additionally updates how wasm features are processed during validating a deserialized module to only require enabled features to be enabled in the host. Previously modules that disabled a feature but the feature was enabled in the host would fail to deserialize. All WebAssembly proposals are additive, however, so it's always ok to disable a feature and then load it into a module that enables the wasm proposal.</p>\n<p>Closes #11450</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
