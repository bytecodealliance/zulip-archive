This change alone does not really do all that much but the goal is to reduce the diff between this repository and the wasip3-prototyping repository. The main change included here is synchronizing the list of libcalls. That necessitates changing various concrete signatures of libcalls and all implementations are replaced with <code>todo!()</code> for now to get filled in in the future. Additionally this necessitates changes to the trampoline compilation as well which is brought wholesale from the wasip3-prototyping repository.</p>\n<p>Note that this should all be well-tested and covered in the wasip3-prototyping repository so no extra tests are brought in at this time. The intention is that once the runtime bits start landing here upstream it'll be accompanied with appropriate tests.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
