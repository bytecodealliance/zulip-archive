This refactors the implementation internally to share more code with <code>FuncEnvironment</code> through some traits to ensure that the same knobs and plumbing are used to translate traps.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
