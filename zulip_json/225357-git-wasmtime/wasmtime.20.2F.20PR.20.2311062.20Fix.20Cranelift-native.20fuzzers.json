This error got covered up by accident when generating the fuzz test case, however, meaning that the error was not noticed. This changes builder configuration to using <code>.unwrap()</code> more liberally for options that are all known should be enabled.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
