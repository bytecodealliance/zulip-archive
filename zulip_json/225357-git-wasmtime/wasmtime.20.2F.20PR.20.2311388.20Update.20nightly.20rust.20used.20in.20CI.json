This still isn't ready for prime-time so it's just as gated as before, but we can promote a <code>cargo check</code> to a <code>cargo test</code> in CI.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
