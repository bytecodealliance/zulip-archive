So that's an <code>Arc</code> clone and drop just to get a <code>VMMemoryDefinition</code>, which is just a pointer and a length, essentially a slice of the linear memory. And, among other places, we call <code>LocalMemory::vmmemory</code> to get the GC heap's memory base and bound every time we access a GC object from Rust (for example, during collections).</p>\n<p>Altogether, this removes another 30% of runtime from the testcase in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11141\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11141</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

It might be nicer to instead add a <code>vmmemory</code> method to <code>RuntimeLinearMemory</code> and push <code>VMMemoryDefinition</code> construction down to implementations of that trait, rather than tying together the results of different <code>RuntimeLinearMemory</code> methods in <code>LocalMemory</code>.</p>\n<p>That would actually let us avoid an indirect call too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Now:<ul>\n<li><code>LocalMemory</code> indirect-calls the <code>byte_size</code> method through a <code>dyn RuntimeLinearMemory</code></li>\n<li><code>LocalMemory</code> indirect-calls the <code>base</code> (now <code>base_non_null</code> in this PR) method through a <code>dyn RuntimeLinearMemory</code></li>\n<li><code>LocalMemory</code> puts them together into a <code>VMMemoryDefinition</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Alternative:<ul>\n<li><code>LocalMemory</code> indirect-calls the hypothetical <code>vmmemory</code> method through a <code>dyn RuntimeLinearMemory</code></li>\n<li>The <code>RuntimeLinearMemory</code> implementation gets its byte size and base, which can both be done directly/inlined/etc because we aren't crossing a <code>dyn</code> boundary anymore</li>\n<li>The <code>RuntimeLinearMemory</code> implementation puts them together into a <code>VMMemoryDefinition</code></li>\n<li>The <code>VMMemoryDefinition</code> is returned to the <code>LocalMemory</code>, which returns it to its caller in turn</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the \"now\" sequence has two indirect calls while the alternative has only one.</p>\n<p>I'm going to whip this alternative up real quick and then update this PR.</p>\n</blockquote>",
