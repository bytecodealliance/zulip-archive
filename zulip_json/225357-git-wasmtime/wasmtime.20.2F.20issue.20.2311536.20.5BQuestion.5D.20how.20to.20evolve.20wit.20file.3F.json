I'd recommend following the WASI precedent here which is to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure all packages have a version.</li>\n<li>Once a package is \"published\" (aka consumable by your plugins) then nothing about its types/functions can change.</li>\n<li>Addition of new functions/types/interfaces, however, is possible in point release versions.</li>\n<li>Your runtime and guests naturally use the latest version of WITs they had at the time of building, and those continue to work indefinitely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Does that work for your use case?</p>\n<p>For sharing WITs I'd recommend <code>wkg</code> from <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasm-pkg-tools\">here</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
