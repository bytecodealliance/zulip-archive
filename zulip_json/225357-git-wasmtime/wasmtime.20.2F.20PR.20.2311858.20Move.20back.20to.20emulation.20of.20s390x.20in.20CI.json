Watching the queue today it looks like PRs are spending quite a lot of time waiting for runners to become available to execute jobs on. Looking at the data for the past week jobs are frequently queuing for 10+ minutes before being able to run. Given that our CI completes in ~15 minutes that more-or-less defeats the purpose of the native runners, so this commit switches back to github actions for now which should resolve the queueing issues.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
