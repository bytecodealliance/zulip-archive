This makes conversion from internal global state to external global state a noop along the lines of previous commits. The end goal is to remove <code>Stored</code> entirely and enable more pervasively using external types internally within Wasmtime as well.</p>\n<p>Globals were different than the prior iterations of memories, tags, and tables. Globals have three different ways of defining them: wasm instances, the host embedder, and component flags. Representing these in all the various locations required a bit of finesse in how everything is represented and stored at rest and such. In the end there's a small amount of \"type punning\" in a few instance/vmctx fields related to globals now since everything is squeezed into one slot. This is required because the <code>VMGlobalImport</code> structure must have a size known to wasm-compiled code and <code>wasmtime::Global</code> must have a known layout for C code.</p>\n<p>In the end while this is more code to manage globals my hope is that the end result will be a net negative in terms of complexity by ensuring that the embedder API is additionally suitable for use internally within Wasmtime as well.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
