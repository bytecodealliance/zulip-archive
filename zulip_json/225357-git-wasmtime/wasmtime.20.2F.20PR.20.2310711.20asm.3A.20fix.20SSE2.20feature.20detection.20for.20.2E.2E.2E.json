This is not the most critical bug fix, since SSE2 was released in 2000 and all x86 CPUs past that date should have both SSE and SSE2 present. But this corrects the record and illustrates how to add new features.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
