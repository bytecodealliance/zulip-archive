I'm not sure if modules have useful names inside components, or how to find those names if they exist.

This is with components and for this first pass I'm looking at each of the modules with text include pc and then finding the first one that has a func including pc which appears to work well but, I think, could be wrong in cases of code sharing.</p>\n<p>![Image](<a href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69cb7646-a66d-450f-afa1-84256394d4dd\">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69cb7646-a66d-450f-afa1-84256394d4dd</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>",
