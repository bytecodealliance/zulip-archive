Unfortunately, three unimplemented SSE instructions (<code>vpmaddwd</code>, <code>vpmaddubsw</code>, <code>vpshufb</code>) prevent us from fully removing <code>Inst::XmmRmiRVex</code> and its ISLE helper, <code>xmm_rmir_vex</code>; we can remove those later once the SSE versions are implemented.</p>\n<p>Beyond small format-related changes in Cranelift to accept the new VEX shapes, the largest change comes in Winch: because of how <code>AvxOpcode</code> was passed around previously, I was forced to create new constructors and refactor various bits. I resisted the temptation to go too far, but I could not resist making some of these constructors more consistent, e.g., using common suffixes (<code>rrr</code>, <code>rri</code>) and moving like instructions closer to each other.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This is coming because this PR switched the order of the operands as it lowered the instruction and I think this operand swap makes more sense.
