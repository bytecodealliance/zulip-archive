It's vacuously true that the capacity of <code>ValueRegs</code> is four registers on targets with only 32-bit registers, because we have no such targets; but more importantly it documents the intent, which is that it should always have capacity for 128 bits. Not really worth bikeshedding better text here IMHO. I'll go ahead and close this issue but thanks for raising it!</p>\n</blockquote>",
