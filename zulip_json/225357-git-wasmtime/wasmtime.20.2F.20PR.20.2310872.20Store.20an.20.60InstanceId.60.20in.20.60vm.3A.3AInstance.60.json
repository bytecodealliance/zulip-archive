This doesn't have any affect on the public API but it's will result eventually in changes to the internals of types in the public API. This change is also done in preparation for simplifying <code>Stored&lt;T&gt;</code> and how it works in Wasmtime to avoid requiring allocations (aka pushing onto a <code>StoreData</code> vector) when converting from Wasmtime's internal representation to the external representation of tables, globals, memories, etc.</p>\n<p>For now all this commit does is add <code>id: InstanceId</code> to the <code>vm::Instance</code> structure. This led to some refactorings to ensure that it's correctly listed by centralizing various methods to allocate an instance into one helper method which manages this configuration.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
