These changes are fairly simple, but still change a lot of files - so I figured I'd start with some of the most obvious tests and check whether I'm going about making these changes the right way.</p>\n<p>In terms of actual changes, the following rename has been applied:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>preview2_</code> -&gt; <code>p2_</code></li>\n<li><code>api_</code> -&gt; <code>p2_api_</code></li>\n<li><code>cli_</code> -&gt; <code>p2_cli_</code></li>\n<li><code>http_</code> -&gt; <code>p2_http_</code></li>\n<li><code>preview1_</code> -&gt; <code>p1_</code></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Thought on a follow-up PR</h2>\n<p>Assuming this PR looks good and CI passes, I'm wondering what to do about some of the other tests. For example, we have the <code>nn_</code> tests that are currently p2-only. I'm inclined to prefix those as <code>p2_nn_</code>, with the anticipation that eventually they will become <code>p3_nn_</code> once they're moved over.</p>\n<p>There are also the <code>async_</code> tests. Should those be renamed to <code>p3_async_</code>? They're just about the component model, and not WASI directly. But they do exercise the p3 bindings generation. I feel like things would be different if the were Wast tests. But for now I'm inclined to say we should prefix those as <code>p3_async_</code> in a follow-up PR.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Basically for testing I think it's worthwhile keeping a separation between \"p3\" being WASIp3 and \"component model async\" being separate.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
