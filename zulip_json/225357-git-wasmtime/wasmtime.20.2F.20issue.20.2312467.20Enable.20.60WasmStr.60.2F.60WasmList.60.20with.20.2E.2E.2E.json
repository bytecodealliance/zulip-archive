The reason for this is that post-return is invoked automatically meaning that using these types would be using already-free'd memory in the guest. We should enable these types to work to unlock the possibility of zero-copy return values. This'll probably look like some sort of closure/trait passed to <code>call_concurrent</code> (ish) which is invoked once the values are received.</p>\n<p>This is somewhat related to #12427 insofar as post-return is causing issues there.</p>\n</blockquote>",
