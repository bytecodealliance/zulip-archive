There are instructions under the <code>and</code> family that, when a <code>REX</code> prefix is prepended, end up sign-extending their operands. When this encoding is used, they have limitations on their registers: \"In 64-bit mode, r/m8 can not be encoded to access the following byte registers if a REX prefix is used: AH, BH, CH, DH.\" Since we won't be using the high 8-bit slots here, we can probably disregard that, but that was one of the initial concerns. The second concern is that, in documenting these instructions, it is not clear if there are mistakes: some of these <code>REX + ...</code> indicate sign extension for certain instructions but not others (e.g., compare <code>and</code>'s <code>RM</code> format and <code>or</code>'s <code>RM</code> format. The third is that, with both Capstone and XED, we don't really see a difference in the disassembled string, so our fuzzing cannot check that we correctly emit one instruction and not the other. Currently thinking about what to do...</p>\n</blockquote>",
