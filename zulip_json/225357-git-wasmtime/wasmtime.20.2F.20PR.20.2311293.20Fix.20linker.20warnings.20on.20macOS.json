The additions you had here in this PR looked correct to me and my comment was about how the similar linking directive in <code>examples/CMakeLists.txt</code> were redundant (or at least I think they were).</p>\n<p>In the meantime this all looks good to me so I'll flag it for merge, but if you'd like I'd be happy to merge a PR with the changes of linking to <code>CoreFoundation</code></p>\n</blockquote>",
