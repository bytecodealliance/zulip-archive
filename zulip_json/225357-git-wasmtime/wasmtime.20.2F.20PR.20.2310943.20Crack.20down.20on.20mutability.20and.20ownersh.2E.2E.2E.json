This is specifically addressing two points of safety around <code>vm::Instance</code>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Previously ownership of this was murky where <code>InstanceHandle</code> sort of represented ownership but sort of didn't either through the <code>InstanceHandle::clone</code> method. Now <code>InstanceHandle</code> has a destructor for instances and no longer has <code>clone</code>, so there's one exclusive owner of an instance.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Previously <code>&amp;mut Instance</code> was liberally passed around, but this is not sound because certain fields cannot be mutated (e.g. runtime offset information). While not a perfect solution this PR switches to using <code>Pin&lt;&amp;mut Instance&gt;</code> everywhere instead. This prevents safe access to <code>&amp;mut Instance</code> and we hand-write accessors to individual fields. Notably we omit mutable access to the <code>runtime_info</code> field.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This naturally involved a lot of refactoring internally, but notably this started bringing up preexisting issues around how there are locations in the codebase that simultaneously have <code>&amp;mut Instance</code> and <code>&amp;mut StoreOpaque</code> which is technically not sound due to being able to get back to the instance from the store. Some issues here were address by passing around indices more often such as in instance initialization and const-expr evaluation.</p>\n<p>Note that all proxy methods on <code>InstanceHandle</code> are also all removed now and there's now only two: <code>get</code> and <code>get_mut</code>. This reflects how <code>InstanceHandle</code> should in general no longer be used and instead <code>Instance</code> itself, and some pointer-to thereof, should be exclusively used.</p>\n<p>cc #10933</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
