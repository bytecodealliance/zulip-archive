Previously there was a significant amount of duplication between the two which has been exacerbated through time. This commit refactors the state of affairs to ensure that all the shared logic between the two is in one location and the only difference is what they're already doing different (e.g. lifting/lowering guts).</p>\n<p>The high-level goal here was to see if this was possible, but in the end this feels like a much cleaner state of affairs than prior as far fewer details are duplicated across a few locations. The host function behavior is slightly more \"dynamic\" than before in the sense that statically-known signature has a few more type lookups than before, for example, but this can be fixed in due time if necessary.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
