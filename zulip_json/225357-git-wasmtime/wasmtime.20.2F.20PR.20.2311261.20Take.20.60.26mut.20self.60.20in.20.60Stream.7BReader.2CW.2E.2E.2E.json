This is something which I personally feel is more idiomatic and avoids cumbersome and possibly frequent move-in-and-move-out style code. This is additionally coupled with a new <code>is_closed</code> method on each of these types to determine if the stream's other end has been closed after the last read/write operation.</p>\n<p>Closes #11219</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
