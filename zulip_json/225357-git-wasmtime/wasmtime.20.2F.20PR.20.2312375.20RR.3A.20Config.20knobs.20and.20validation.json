Historically as various config options have been tied together it's caused problems and made configuration more confusing due to trying to understand how everything interacts with each other. In some sense producing a recording is entirely orthogonal to deterministic simd/nans. In another sense I also understand how such a recording runs the risk of not being too useful.</p>\n<p>For the engine-level configuration I'd argue, however, that this is best kept as a separate concern where we'd document in the RR configuration options that users probably also want to turn on deterministic things, but it wouldn't be a requirement.</p>\n<p>Such a change would also have the nice benefit of keeping <code>validate</code> as <code>&amp;self</code> vs <code>&amp;mut self</code> changed in this PR. That's been an intentional design so far where <code>Config</code> is intended to not need any sort of post-processing. If post-processing is necessary we try to defer it to \"store the result of the computation in the <code>Engine</code>\" so <code>Config</code> continues to reflect the source of truth of configuration specified.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The two options handled here, NaN bits and relaxed-simd, are pretty low down on the list of \"things that practically cause nondeterminism\" in wasm with resource exhaustion (stacks or memory) being much higher on that list. RR cannot control resource exhaustion during replay in the sense that it can't necessarily predict the stack consumption (maybe memory? that seems relatively advanced)</p>\n<p>Basically I would expect that divergence of a replay from the original recording is something that's going to need to be handled no matter what. I think it'd be reasonable, for example, for the CLI to automatically set these options but at the <code>wasmtime::Config</code> layer we've generally had bad experiences tying all these together.</p>\n<p>Put another way, I would be surprised if we could actually achieve absolutely perfect determinism during a record and replay. Inevitably it seems like we'll forget events, have bugs that prevent this, etc. Assuming perfect determinism to me sounds like it's going to introduce more subtle bugs than not and be a pretty steep uphill battle</p>\n</blockquote>",

However I also think, having seen and thought through a lot of the challenges here, that is enormously complex and opens a huge new Pandora's box of issues. For example, with reversible debugging, which builds on top of replay, the whole algorithm depends on determinism; we'll back ourselves into fundamentally unsolvable corners if we don't have it.</p>\n<p>See also e.g. how rr (the Mozilla project) panics with internal asserts if trace replay mismatches. I think that's the only really reasonable way to go here: we'll have asserts when we have mismatches. In other words, yep there may be bugs; let's treat them as bugs and catch and fix them.</p>\n<p>Resource exhaustion is of course a different category: early termination because a memory.grow failed on replay is reasonable to propagate through and we already have the error paths for that.

How exactly that plays out for this can be workable in a few ways (e.g. decouple these options, change those reading the options, change the source-of-truth for the options, etc).</p>\n</blockquote>",
