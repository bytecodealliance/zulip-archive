Due to using <code>wkg</code> instead of <code>curl</code> + <code>tar</code> the WITs themselves are textually changing in this PR, but their meaning isn't changing. Instead what's happening is they're all getting merged into one large <code>*.wit</code>-per-package.</p>\n<p>The goal here is to split out this step from #12250 to first change how WITs are managed and then subsequently update the WITs (also related to #12247). By updating how WITs are managed we also unblock the ability to update in Wasmtime since per-proposal repos have been sunset for WASI meaning that structural changes to the update script are required no matter what to update beyond our current version.</p>\n</blockquote>",
