You had mentioned a separate pointer type before, which we've resisted so far in order to avoid a lot of complexity and duplication. Perhaps we can have a surface-level syntax sugar in the textual CLIF parser, though: <code>stack_addr.ptr</code> rather than <code>stack_addr.{i32,i64}</code>. What do you think?</li>\n<li>Perhaps we should have a helper on <code>InstructionData</code> that is something like <code>fn addr(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;Value&gt;</code>, returning the address operand, if any, of the instruction; so we can centralize that and don't have to enumerate the cases in the verifier.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",

You had mentioned a separate pointer type before, which we've resisted so far in order to avoid a lot of complexity and duplication. Perhaps we can have a surface-level syntax sugar in the textual CLIF parser, though: stack_addr.ptr rather than stack_addr.{i32,i64}. What do you think?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I guess one could just instantiate both flavours for each function, and store them in separate fields, or in an enum type in the <code>functions</code> field that's currently in <a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-reader/latest/cranelift_reader/struct.TestFile.html\">TestFile</a>? But then it may also make sense to split the <code>isa_spec</code> field into the two flavours and group the respective isa's with the functions that were instantiated for them? It does make the struct more complex though.</p>\n<p>Another option, which is not great because it splits files, but it's worth considering because it may allow more reuse. If one clif file can refer to another file, it's easy to do the syntactic sugar approach, for something like <code>fdemote_32.clif</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">test</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">interpret</span>\n<span class=\"n\">test</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">run</span>\n<span class=\"n\">target</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">pulley32</span>\n<span class=\"n\">target</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">pulley32be</span>\n<span class=\"n\">include</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">fdemote</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">clif</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>For; <code>fdemote_64.clif</code>:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">test</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">interpret</span>\n<span class=\"n\">test</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">run</span>\n<span class=\"n\">target</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">pulley64</span>\n<span class=\"n\">include</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">fdemote</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">clif</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The included file <code>fdemote.cliff</code> contains entries that use <code>stack_addr.ptr</code>. </p>\n<p>When the reader reads files, it keeps track of which isa's it has seen, as long as it has only seen 32 bit isa's <code>stack_addr.ptr</code> would be <code>i32</code>, if it has only seen 64 bit isa's the value of <code>stack_addr.ptr</code> would be <code>i64</code>, if both isa's are seen and <code>stack_addr.ptr</code> is used, an error is raised. This also allows for reuse of functions defined in one file by other files, if that would be convenient (I don't know if any of the current tests would benefit from that). </p>\n<p>The current situation of splitting out some files is not that problematic though, it is simple and straightforward. I wouldn't be surprised if I'm in the first person to run into this thing as I used that example from the documentation AND used a debug build to hit that assert. Personally I'd lean towards not doing anything on this front until either the split files become a burden or other reasons arise to pursue a change, at least, I don't see a solution that reduces complexity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perhaps we should have a helper on InstructionData that is something like fn addr(&amp;self) -&gt; Option&lt;Value&gt;, returning the address operand, if any, of the instruction; so we can centralize that and don't have to enumerate the cases in the verifier.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The <code>Option&lt;Value&gt;</code> is a bit of a limiting interface though, because it implies that each function has zero or one address operand, the <a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-codegen/latest/cranelift_codegen/ir/trait.InstBuilder.html#method.stack_switch\">stack_switch</a> has three, so then you'd end up with having to make a decision which of the arguments is the address, for most it may work though, or change it to a Vec? Thinking about the generalization here, this would allow <code>InstructionData</code> to 'opt in' to an address verifier check, I wonder if there would be a way to generalise this further and allow the instructions to specify which checks should be ran on its arguments... Not sure if this would just 'move code' instead of 'reduce code' though, I don't know enough about cranelift to answer that :)</p>\n</blockquote>",
