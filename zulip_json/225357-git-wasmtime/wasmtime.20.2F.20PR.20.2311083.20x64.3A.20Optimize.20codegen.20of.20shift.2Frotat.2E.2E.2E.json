This commit updates instruction selection to use these encodings when shifts-by-immediate are encountered.</p>\n<p>Note that these new instructions in the assembler all have custom <code>Display</code> implementations. The Capstone disassembly is a bit odd where the immediate is printed as <code>$1</code> instead of <code>$0x1</code> and additionally the immediate isn't printed at all when the thing-to-be-shifted is a memory location.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
