We should change the text of the warning for components to indicate that the wave text format may be unstable, since that is early enough in development and use that we don't want to guarantee stability there forever.</p>\n<h4>Alternatives</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Do nothing - leave module invoke unstable forever. Its a niche feature which is of pretty limited use.<br>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
