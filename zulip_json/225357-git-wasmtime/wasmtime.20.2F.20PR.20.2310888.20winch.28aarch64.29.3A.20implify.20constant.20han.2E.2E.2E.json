The implemettaion is identical to the existing for x64,<br>\n  however, it's abstracted so that it can be easily consumed from any<br>\n  existing backend.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Usage of the constant pool from aarch64, which simplifies the<br>\n  loading of constants, particularly floating point constants.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The main motivation behind this change is to _eventually_ detach the<br>\nimplicit usage of the scatch register from constant loading as much as<br>\npossible, reducing the possibility of subtle bugs (like the one<br>\ndescribed in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10829\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10829</a>).</p>\n<p>Note that I have a work-in-progress branch from where all these<br>\nchanges are cherry picked from, to make everything easier to review.</p>\n<p>A side effect of this change, is the improvement to the code<br>\ngeneration involving floating point constants. Prior to this change,<br>\nmultiple moves were involved, with this patch, at most 1 move is<br>\nrequired and at worst one load is required.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
