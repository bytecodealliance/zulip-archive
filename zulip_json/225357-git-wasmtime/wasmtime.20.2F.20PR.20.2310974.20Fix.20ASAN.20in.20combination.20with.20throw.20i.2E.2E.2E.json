I don't know why CI is currently passing on all PRs when this is failing so frequently for myself locally.</p>\n<p>In any case it seems like there's a magical ASAN intrinsic to call before <code>noreturn</code> things which I think is intended for thread-stopping events which isn't a great fit for exceptions here but it seems to resolve the crash.</p>\n<p>Basically I have no idea why things crash locally, what this new function does, nor why it fixes things. I am but a slave to the CI gods in an attempt to make it so our CI is more reliable.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
