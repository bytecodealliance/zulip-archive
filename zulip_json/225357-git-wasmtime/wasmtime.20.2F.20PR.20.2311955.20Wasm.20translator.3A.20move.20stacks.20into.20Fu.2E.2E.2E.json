It turns out that carrying through the multiple bits was becoming fairly verbose plumbing and it is desired to collapse it somewhat.</p>\n<p>This PR puts <code>FuncTranslationStacks</code> under <code>FuncEnvironment</code>. As a result, all of our Wasmtime-specific state is now in one container that we can plumb through more easily.</p>\n<p>There is a tiny bit more cloning here: calls and a few other instructions were peeking a slice of the operand stack and passing that into a method on the environ (taking a mut self) to codegen certain sequences. An alternative would have been to indirect somehow -- pass a <code>Range&lt;usize&gt;</code> or a closure that gets the environ back to yield the args slice -- but it didn't seem worth the complexity here. Happy to change if needed.</p>\n<p>[here]: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11921#discussion_r2461912848\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11921#discussion_r2461912848</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
