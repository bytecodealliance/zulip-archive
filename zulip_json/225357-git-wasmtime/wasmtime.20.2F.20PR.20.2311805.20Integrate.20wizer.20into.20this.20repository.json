The goal is to consolidate these features here in Wasmtime and provide it as part of the <code>wasmtime</code> CLI itself. This is intended to reduce maintenance burden by only having one repo to manage instead of multiple. To that end the changes in this PR are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Subsequent commits adjust CI integration files, other management files, etc, to all fit within Wasmtime's repository.</li>\n<li>Commits then get the new <code>wasmtime-wizer</code> crate compiling in this workspace and passing tests.</li>\n<li>Commits then create a new <code>wasmtime wizer</code> subcommand which has the same arguments/behavior of <code>wasmtime run</code> by literally using the same implementation of execution internally (e.g. supports all WASI proposals and such)</li>\n<li>Finally there's assorted miscellaneous things like getting the fuzzer compiling, benchmarks compiling, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall I think this is in a good-enough state to upstream into this repository as a first step. The next step will be to refactor the internals of <code>wasmtime-wizer</code> to be amenable for sharing with <code>component-init</code> itself. This'll include trying to make <code>wasmtime-wizer</code> more runtime-agnostic by, in theory, having just a single trait that a runtime need implement and severing the dependency on <code>wasmtime</code> (or at least optionally severing the dependency).</p>\n<p>With such refactorings in place the next step I'd take is to fold the component-init repository into <code>wasmtime-wizer</code>. That'll require yet more reorganization and finesse though so I'd like to split this across multiple PRs instead of having one large PR.</p>\n</blockquote>",
