Effectively it's always been a cost that converting from an internal representation to the external representation pushes onto some internal vectors. Making this cost go away will fix the above issues.</li>\n<li>Enable using public exports in the internal implementation of wasmtime. Historically the internals of Wasmtime are implemented very differently than what the users of Wasmtime get to use. That creates this weird dichotomy where externally everyone gets to learn one API while internally it's completely different.

The original motivation was myself working in the wasip3-prototyping branch and brainstorming ways to reduce the amount of unsafety.
