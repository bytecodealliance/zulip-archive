This required rejiggering and refactoring the <code>imm</code> constructor in ISLE and refactoring the <code>Inst::imm</code> method as well.</p>\n<p>One minor change in this PR is that the immediate <code>u64::from(u32::MAX)</code> was mistakenly classified previously as requiring <code>movabsq</code> but after this PR it's now classified as being able to use <code>movl</code> because the upper bits are zero'd with <code>movl</code>. This was an off-by-one mistake in the <code>nonzero_u64_fits_in_u32</code> extractor that was deleted in this PR.</p>\n<p>This change also documents the preexisting behavior of the <code>imm</code> constructor and the <code>Inst::imm</code> helper which is to zero the upper bits of the 64-bit immediate passed in to those functions if the desired size is less than 64-bits. This is something I would prefer to avoid because it means the logical value of the immediate is not being preserved which could be a way to possibly subtly introduce bugs in the future. For now though more widespread changes would be needed to fix this so they're omitted.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
