Previously <code>*mut ComponentInstance</code> was liberally used but this meant that situations would often simultaneously have <code>&amp;mut ComponentInstance</code> and <code>&amp;mut StoreOpaque</code> accessible in the same function and there was no prevention of going from the store to the component instance, acquiring two aliasing mutable references (which would be unsound). The refactoring applied here is to redefine the entrypoints from the guest back into the host to operate on <code>&amp;mut dyn VMStore</code> (or <code>StoreContextMut&lt;'_, T&gt;</code>) plus<br>\n<code>wasmtime::component::Instance</code>. This index-based approach means that there's no aliasing of component instances and stores and the <code>Instance</code> type can be used to look up anything within the store that's necessary.</p>\n<p>This refactoring originated in the wasip3-prototyping repository and has been used to remove a good deal of <code>unsafe</code> code now that <code>Instance</code> is effectively safe to pass around and the store was already passed around anyway everywhere.</p>\n<p>In the future I plan to apply a similar paradigm shift for core instances as well, but that'll require some more finesse for all the bits and bobs that core wasm does.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
