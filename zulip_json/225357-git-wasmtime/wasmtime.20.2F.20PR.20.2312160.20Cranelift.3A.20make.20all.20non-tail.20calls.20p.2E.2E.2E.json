In particular, we will need patchable <code>try_call</code> callsites as well in order to allow breakpoint handlers to throw exceptions (desirable functionality eventually) and have this work in the presence of inlining. Also, it's just a nice generalization to say that patchability is an orthogonal dimension to the call ABI and the other restrictions we initially imposed, and works as long as the basic requirement (no return values) is met.</p>\n<p>This also renames the <code>patchable</code> ABI to <code>preserve_all</code>, to make it clear that its purpose is actually orthogonal, and it can be used independently of patchable callsites. It also deletes the <code>cold</code> ABI, which never actually did anything and is misleading in the presence of an actual cold-ish (subzero temperature, actually) ABI like <code>preserve_all</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
