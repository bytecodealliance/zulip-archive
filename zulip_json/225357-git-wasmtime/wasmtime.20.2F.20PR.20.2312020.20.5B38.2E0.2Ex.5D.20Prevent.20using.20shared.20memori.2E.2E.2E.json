This is not sound because <code>wasmtime::Memory</code> provides safe Rust access to the bytes where that is not possible with wasm shared memories. Shared memories in Rust must be represented by <code>SharedMemory</code>, not <code>wasmtime::Memory</code>.</p>\n<p>Specifically this commit prevents two vectors of this happening:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><code>Memory::new</code> now requires that the memory type specified is non-shared. Instead <code>SharedMemory::new</code> must be used instead.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Core dumps now skip over shared memories when iterating over all memories in the store. Supporting shared memories is a more invasive change and will happen on Wasmtime's <code>main</code> branch.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
