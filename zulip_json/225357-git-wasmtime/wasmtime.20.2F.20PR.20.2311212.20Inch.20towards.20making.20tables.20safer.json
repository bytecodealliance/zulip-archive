That required updating one location which required both a <code>&amp;mut Table</code> and a <code>&amp;mut GcStore</code> at the same time with a new helper on the store. More of these sorts of helpers are likely going to be necessary but IMO it's a small price to pay for safety.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
