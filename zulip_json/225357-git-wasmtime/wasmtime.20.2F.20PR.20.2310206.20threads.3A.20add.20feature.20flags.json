In that sense the current <code>threads</code> proposal is gated because it requires mutexes/etc to implement atomic notify/wait.  I don't think that <code>shared-everything-threads</code> will require any more than <code>threads</code>, though, but any nontrivial dependency above the <code>core</code> crate should be gated.</p>\n<p>(or do you have specific things you're curious about too?)</p>\n</blockquote>",
