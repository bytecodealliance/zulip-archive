Like #11238 this is done to make future refactorings easier for the internal implementation but the internal implementations are not updated at this time. Many functions, for example, do not use the argument at all just yet. The purpose of this is to ensure host usage of these functions always provides a store context.</p>\n<p>This change required large refactorings of the upcoming wasmtime-wasi-http implementation in the wasip3-prototyping repository. That's all been sorted out now though so the changes are being pulled back here into the Wasmtime repository as well.</p>\n<p>This commit additionally changes the <code>watch_*</code> functions on the various stream/future types to take <code>&amp;mut self</code> instead of <code>self</code>-by-value. This is mostly a stylistic change and is more API-driven than anything else. Functionally this behaves the same as before where, while watching, the stream/future cannot be read/written to otherwise.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
