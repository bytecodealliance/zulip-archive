This then additionally removes the <code>Cmove</code> pseudo-inst in favor of these new instructions. One difference from before is that the naming in the <code>CC</code> enum does not exactly match what mnemonics Capstone uses to disassemble. For example <code>CC.NB</code> in ISLE corresponds to the Intel instruction <code>CMOVNB</code>. This instruction, however, has the same encoding as <code>CMOVAE</code> and Capstone disassembles as <code>CMOVAE</code>. This means that the instruction selection in ISLE isn't a 1:1 match with mnemonics.</p>\n<p>This additionally adds support in the assembler ISLE generation to understand that instructions which read EFLAGS generate a <code>ConsumesFlags</code> variant in their instruction helpers.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
