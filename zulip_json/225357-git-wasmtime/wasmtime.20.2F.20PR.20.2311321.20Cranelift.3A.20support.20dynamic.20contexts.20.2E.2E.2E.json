This fundamentally requires the unwinder to be able to resolve the current Wasm instance for each Wasm frame on the stack that has any handlers, and our frame format does not provide this today.</p>\n<p>We discussed many options, some of which solve the more general problem (Wasm vmctx for any frame), but ultimately landed on a notion of \"dynamic context for evaluating tags\", specific to Cranelift's exception-catch metadata; and storing that context and carrying it through to a place that is named in the unwind metadata. The reasoning is fairly straightforward: we cannot afford a more general approach that stores vmctx in every frame (I measured this at 20% overhead for a recursive-Fibonacci benchmark that is call-intensive); and inlining means that we may have <em>multiple</em> contexts at any given program point, each associated with a different slice of the handler tags; so we need a mechanism that, <em>just for a try-call</em>, intersperses contexts with tags (or puts a context on each tag) and stores these somewhere that the exception-unwind ABI doesn't clobber (e.g., on the stack).</p>\n<p>This PR implements \"option 4\" from that issue, namely, <em>dynamic exception contexts</em>. The idea is that this is the dual to exception payload: while payload lets the unwinder communicate state <em>to</em> the catching code, context lets the unwinder take state <em>from</em> the catching code that lets it decide whether the tag is a match. Because of inlining, we need to either associate (optional) context with every tag, or intersperse context-updates with handler tags. I've opted for the latter for efficiency at the CLIF level (in most cases there will be multiple tags per context), though they are isomorphic.</p>\n<p>The new tag-matching semantics are: when walking up the stack, upon reaching a <code>try_call</code>, evaluate catch-clauses in listed order. A <code>context</code> clause sets the current context. A <code>tagN: block(...)</code> clause attempts to match the throwing exception against <code>tagN</code>, <em>evaluated in the current context</em>, and branches to the named block if it matches. A <code>default: block(...)</code> always branches to the named block.</p>\n<p>Note that this lets us assume less about tags than before, and this particularly manifests in the changes to the inliner. Whereas before, <code>tagN</code> is <code>tagN</code> and an inner handler for that tag shadows an outer handler (that is, tags always alias if identical indices); and whereas before, <code>tagN</code> is not <code>tagM</code> and so we can order the tags arbitrarily (that is, tags never alias if non-identical indices); now any two static tag indices may or may not alias depending on the dynamic context of each. Or, even in the same context, two may alias, because we leave the match-predicate as an unspecified (user-chosen) algorithm during unwinding. (This mirrors the reality that, for example, a Wasm instance may import two tags, and dynamically these tags may be equal or different at runtime, even instantiation-to-instantiation.) Cranelift's only job is to faithfully carry the list of contexts and tags through to the compiled-code metadata; and to ensure that they remain in the order they were specified in the CLIF.</p>\n<p>This PR introduces the Cranelift-level feature, and it will be used in a subsequent PR that introduces Wasm exception handling.

I only added this for genericity based on yesterday's Cranelift meeting (support context in regs/stack in general, assert stack only on the Wasmtime side), but I would rather not build out a bunch of functionality for register-based contexts if it's not actually used; and if it is eventually in Wasmtime, we will likely define our own register mappings. So I am going to go ahead and declare what we have now as Cranelift's \"native\" dynamic exception context register mapping, and we can refine this later as needed -- or if folks would prefer (@alexcrichton?) I can remove the <code>GPR</code> arm here and put the assert and stack-only constraint back into Cranelift.</p>\n</blockquote>",
