Specifically the <code>-Wmax-table-elements</code> option, prior to this change, only affected the store limiter used and didn't actually affect the pooling allocator settings. That meant that if a module exceeded the limits of the pooling allocator it would produce an error message that seemed like <code>-Wmax-table-elements</code> would fix but it wouldn't actually.</p>\n<p>Two changes in this commit are meant to address this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Errors from the pooling allocator have been update to mention \"pooling allocator\" within them somewhere to surface where the error is coming from.</li>\n<li>The <code>-Wmax-memory-size</code> and <code>-Wmax-table-elements</code> configuration are now applied to the pooling allocator automatically if the corresponding <code>-Opooling-*</code> option isn't passed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That should mean that the original error should be a bit easier to debug while the attempted solution will also work.</p>\n<p>Closes #10482<br>\n&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
