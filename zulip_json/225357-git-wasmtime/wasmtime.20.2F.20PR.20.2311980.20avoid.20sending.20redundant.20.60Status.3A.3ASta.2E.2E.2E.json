The latter was redundant, but it didn't matter in most cases because the second event usually overwrote the first one such that it was only delivered once.  However, in cases of three or more components composed together, both events got delivered, and that made <code>wit-bindgen</code> justifiably upset.</p>\n<p>This removes the redundant event and adds a three component composition test to cover the scenario.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
