In order to write a sensible top-level example, I felt it was best to refactor how we construct the instructions: this removes the <code>build</code> module and adds conventional <code>&lt;inst_name&gt;::new</code> functions to each instruction. Also, a generated <code>From</code> implementation makes it easier to convert to an <code>Inst</code>.</p>\n<p>This change has other doc-related refactorings and tweaks, but should not change any functionality.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
