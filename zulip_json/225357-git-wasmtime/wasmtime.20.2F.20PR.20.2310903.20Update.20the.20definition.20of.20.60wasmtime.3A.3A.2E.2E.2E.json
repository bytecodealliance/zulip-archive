Instead a <code>StoreInstanceId</code> and a <code>DefinedTableIndex</code> is used instead. This enables construction of external-facing types to be trivial and zero-cost.</p>\n<p>This additionally notably fixes an issue where triggering a GC in a store would unconditionally create a <code>Table</code>, pushing onto an internal vector in the store. This then would never be deallocated because the internal table lived as long as the <code>Store</code>. In effect this meant that triggering a GC would end up leaking memory by pushing more items onto internal <code>Store</code> table. This is fixed through this commit because creating a <code>wasmtime::Table</code> is now \"free\" and no longer requires any allocations.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
