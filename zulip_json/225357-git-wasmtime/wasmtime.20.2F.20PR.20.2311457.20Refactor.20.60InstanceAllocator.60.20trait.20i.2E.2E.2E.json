The <code>InstanceAllocator</code> trait is implemented for everything implementing <code>InstanceAllocatorImpl</code> to force users to be unable to override the default methods. When adding <code>async</code> support internally to Wasmtime these are going to need to be <code>#[async_trait]</code>-annotated-traits which adds a cost to <code>async</code> functions as a future needs to be heap-allocated.</p>\n<p>The goal of this commit is to make this future <code>async</code>-ification a bit more optimal. Notably the <code>InstanceAllocator</code> trait is removed and replaced with inherent methods on <code>impl dyn InstanceAllocatorImpl</code>. After that the previous <code>InstanceAllocatorImpl</code> trait was renamed to <code>InstanceAllocator</code> meaning that there's just one <code>InstanceAllocator</code> trait which has inherent methods which cannot be overridden. A consequence of this is that the inherent methods are also forced to do virtual dispatch unlike before where they would internally use monomorphization to have static dispatch. Given the complexity of instance allocation this is expected to be a negligible cost, however.</p>\n<p>The main benefit is that <code>allocate_module</code>, <code>allocate_tables</code>, and <code>allocate_memories</code> all get to be native <code>async</code> functions without the cost of <code>#[async_trait]</code>. Only allocation of a single table/memory will require an allocation of a future which in profiling helps reduce the cost of instantiation slightly.</p>\n<p>Note that <code>#[async_trait]</code> is not currently used, this commit is just preparation for its eventual use.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
