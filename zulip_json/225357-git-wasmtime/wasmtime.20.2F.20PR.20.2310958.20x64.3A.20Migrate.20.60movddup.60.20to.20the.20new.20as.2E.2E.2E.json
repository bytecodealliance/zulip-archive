Additionally this exposed a shortcoming where Cranelift didn't have access for testing for SSE3 in ISLE (not to be confused with SSSE3). Additionally <code>movddup</code> was incorrectly classified as SSSE3 so this commit fills out some infrastructure to use SSE3 instead of SSSE3. There are more instructions as well that are mis-classified under SSSE3 which I'll address in a follow-up.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

I think that <code>movddup</code> is the only SSE3 instruction that Cranelift supports at this time too.</p>\n</blockquote>",
