A build tool that thinks a build-script run that prints different stderr output is different will also think that a build step that writes to a different file path is different, no? (In other words, are we really \"deterministic\" if Cargo is choosing a different path anyway for different runs?)</p>\n<p>If for some reason only the diagnostic output is the issue, we could probably turn this into a <code>log::info!</code> or similar. Generally though I'd rather we don't remove useful functionality to satisfy (what appears to me at the moment to be) an odd/overly-strict build tool rule.</p>\n</blockquote>",

You are expected to pass an absolute path in <code>cargo::rustc-link-search</code> lines, which should be either a subdirectory of <code>OUT_DIR</code> or a subdirectory of the source path of the crate itself.</p>\n</blockquote>",
