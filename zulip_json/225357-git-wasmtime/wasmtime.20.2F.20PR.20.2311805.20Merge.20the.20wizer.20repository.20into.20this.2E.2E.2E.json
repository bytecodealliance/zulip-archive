The goal is to consolidate these features here in Wasmtime and provide it as part of the <code>wasmtime</code> CLI itself. This is intended to reduce maintenance burden by only having one repo to manage instead of multiple. To that end the changes in this PR are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wizer\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wizer</a> repository is copied, without its git history, into the <code>crates/wizer</code> folder.</li>\n<li>Subsequent commits adjust CI integration files, other management files, etc, to all fit within Wasmtime's repository.</li>\n<li>Commits then get the new <code>wasmtime-wizer</code> crate compiling in this workspace and passing tests.</li>\n<li>Commits then create a new <code>wasmtime wizer</code> subcommand which has the same arguments/behavior of <code>wasmtime run</code> by literally using the same implementation of execution internally (e.g. supports all WASI proposals and such)</li>\n<li>Finally there's assorted miscellaneous things like getting the fuzzer compiling, benchmarks compiling, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall I think this is in a good-enough state to upstream into this repository as a first step. The next step will be to refactor the internals of <code>wasmtime-wizer</code> to be amenable for sharing with <code>component-init</code> itself. This'll include trying to make <code>wasmtime-wizer</code> more runtime-agnostic by, in theory, having just a single trait that a runtime need implement and severing the dependency on <code>wasmtime</code> (or at least optionally severing the dependency).</p>\n<p>With such refactorings in place the next step I'd take is to fold the component-init repository into <code>wasmtime-wizer</code>. That'll require yet more reorganization and finesse though so I'd like to split this across multiple PRs instead of having one large PR.</p>\n</blockquote>",

It's nice to continue to have the git-blame and feels right re: authorship records. Would you be opposed to pulling in the separate git lineage, appending a commit that moves the thing to the right subtree, and joining it all with a merge-commit?</p>\n<p>(Now that I say this, I realize the above two other merges happened before we universally squashed on merge, so maybe this isn't viable unless we break that policy temporarily...)</p>\n</blockquote>",

Assume all goes well the plan would then be to merge #11815 which has all of Wizer's history, rebase this PR which would largely just drop the first commit, and then this PR would get all squashed into one and would be the \"integrate wasmtime and wizer\" PR</p>\n</blockquote>",
