According to <a href=\"https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle\">https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle</a> Ubuntu 16.04 ended standard support 2 years ago and is nearing the end of \"Pro Support\". Overall it seems clear that this version is on the way out and mirrors are getting flakier, so this commit updates the images to 18.04 in an attempt to make CI more reliable under the assumption that mirrors for more recent versions of the distribution are more reliable.</p>\n<p>This has the consequence though that release binaries are going to have a higher glibc requirement. That means if anyone is Downloading Wasmtime onto these older systems and running it then our precompiled binaries will no longer work.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
