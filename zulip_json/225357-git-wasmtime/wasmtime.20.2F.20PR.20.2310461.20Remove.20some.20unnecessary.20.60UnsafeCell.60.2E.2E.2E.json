Everything, including interactions with JIT code, obeys Rust's borrowing rules. Running tests under MIRI still passes, verifying these claims. Therefore, we can remove these <code>UnsafeCell</code>s, which makes the code much easier to read and much less footgun-y since there is less <code>unsafe</code> code and less working with <code>UnsafeCell</code>s' raw pointers.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
