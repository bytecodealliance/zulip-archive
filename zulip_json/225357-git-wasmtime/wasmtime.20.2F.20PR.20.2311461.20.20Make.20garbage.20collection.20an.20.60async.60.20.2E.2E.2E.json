Specifically the functions<br>\nthat actually perform a GC are no longer duplicated across sync, async,<br>\nand maybe async versions. There's only one \"always async\" version and<br>\nthe root-level crate entrypoints for sync versions assert that async<br>\nsupport is disabled and then use the async version.</p>\n<p>Worth noting here is that GC suffers from a preexisting issue described<br>\nin <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11409\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11409</a> where it's not sound how a <code>StoreOpaque</code> is widened to acquire<br>\na resource limiter. This commit seemingly makes the issue worse by<br>\nadding a few more <code>unsafe</code> blocks, but they're all fundamentally doing<br>\nthe same thing as before. Fully solving this issue will require making<br>\nmemory/table creation an <code>async</code> function that takes the limiter as an<br>\nargument. Doing this will require further refactoring/code movement so<br>\nmy goal is to effectively maintain the status quo, but in a slightly<br>\ndifferent location, and enable knocking out the <code>unsafe</code> in the future.<br>\nIn the meantime the previous <code>unsafe</code> block is \"lifted higher up\" so<br>\nit's not quite so deep and should be easier to remove in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>",
