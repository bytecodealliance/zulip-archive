As a result this is the only reliable method of ensuring that differential fuzzing between the interpreter and native backends remains reliable, in the same manner as this being enabled for core wasm as well.</p>\n<p>Closes #10583</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
