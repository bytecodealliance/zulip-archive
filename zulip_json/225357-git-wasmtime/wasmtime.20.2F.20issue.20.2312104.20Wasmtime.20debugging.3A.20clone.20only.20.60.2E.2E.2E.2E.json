In theory we only need to clone the <code>.text</code> section. The clone is often cheap (when the file is mmap'd from disk) but not always, e.g. when compiled in-memory.</p>\n<p>We should clone only <code>.text</code> and separate out the cloned <code>.text</code> in the representation of <code>StoreCodeStorage::Private</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
