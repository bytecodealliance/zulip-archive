This change splits out that functionality into a separate crate that both <code>cranelift-assembler-x64</code> and <code>cranelift-codegen-meta</code> can depend on without depending on each other.</p>\n<p>While doing this, I rationalized the divergence that had happened between both copies of <code>Formatter</code>; more details are noted in the commit messages. As a part of all of this, I will highlight that the <code>Formatter</code> now knows which language it is emitting (Rust or ISLE) and how to emit Rust brace-delimited blocks, a wide-ranging change.</p>\n<p>All of this is to support the same goal as <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10334\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10334</a>. To avoid <code>OUT_DIR</code> issues, I believe we should move the ISLE generation from <code>cranelift-assembler-x64</code> to <code>cranelift-codegen-meta</code> (with the rest of the ISLE wrangling). This PR is a first step in that direction by sorting out the crate dependencies.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I noticed that some fuzzing infrastructure crate had a <code>0.0.0</code> version but perhaps that isn't published?</p>\n</blockquote>",
