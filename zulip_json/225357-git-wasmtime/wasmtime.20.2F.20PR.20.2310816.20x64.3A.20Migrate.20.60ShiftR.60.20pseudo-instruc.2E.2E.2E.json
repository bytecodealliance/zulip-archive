Additionally the old <code>Imm8{Gpr,Reg}</code> abstractions were largely removed and/or replace to only be helpers in ISLE.</p>\n<p>This does regress pcc a bit more than it already is at due to the shift instructions not being special-cased for pcc processing.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
