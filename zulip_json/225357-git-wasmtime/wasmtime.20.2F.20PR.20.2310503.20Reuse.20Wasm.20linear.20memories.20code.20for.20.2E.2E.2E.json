Notably, we also reuse all the associated bounds-checking optimizations and, when possible, virtual-memory techniques to completely elide them.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, this commit adds support for growing GC heaps, reusing the machinery for growing memories, and makes it so that GC heaps always start out empty. This allows us to properly delay allocating the GC heap's storage until a GC object is actually allocated.</p>\n<p>Fixes #9350</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Growing the heap is faster than doing a GC. There are knobs for limiting the max size of memories, including the GC heap, so unbounded growth isn't really a concern (also there is a hard bound of 4 GiB since the GC heap is a 32-bit memory). And we are likely going to throw away the whole store, and the GC heap along with it, before we ever need to collect, and doing that is also much faster than doing a collection.</p>\n</blockquote>",
