This commit adds such a lowering to the Cranelift backend but doesn't add any new instructions yet under the assumption this probably isn't perf-critical at this time.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Basically I wasn't sure if it was worth trying to be 100% correct here when nothing known will hit this, so I opted for a \"will loudly fail\" in the future rather than filling out all the particulars to get this working optimally. I'll look at it again though and see if I can't think of an always-works solution.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Personally I prefer the riscv64 style because I find it easier to work with editors and I don't have to think too hard about lining things up all the time. </p>\n<p>That being said I don't really have a strong preference either way, but in the absence of a style guide/formatter I'll probably leave this as-is since it doesn't deviate too far from the current style (AFAIK)</p>\n</blockquote>",
