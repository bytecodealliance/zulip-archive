These internally used <code>fneg</code> of an operand to switch back-and-forth between two native instructions, but that meant that unoptimized code could control recursion in the backend. The rules additionally weren't necessary since egraphs already optimize away extra <code>fneg</code> nodes meaning that the backends just need to match a single layer.</p>\n<p>I found that I couldn't actually trigger stack overflow in a release build of Wasmtime for either backend. Upon looking at the generated machine code it looks like the constructors here were tail-recursive which prevented the stack overflow. Nonetheless there's no need for this recursion to exist, and in debug mode it definitely blows the stack.</p>\n<p>The two backends are now more similar in structure than they were before, but the meaning of similarly-named functions is different between the two backends to match the native behavior of the generated instructions.</p>\n<p>Closes #12368</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
