We keep track of whether each lifted/lowered function wants args/results as GC values or in linear memory. We additionally plumb through the core function types of the functions being lifted and lowered for (eventual) use with GC adapters.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this commit is enough to fuse together lifted and lowered functions where one or both are using the GC variant of the canonical ABI. Attempting to actually pass arguments will hit <code>todo!()</code>s. The work of implementing those <code>todo!()</code>s is left to future commits.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

By inlining <code>core_def_of_module_instance_export</code> into <code>AliasExportFunc</code> that should become apparent as the only constructor of <code>ExportItem::Name</code> is with imports. For imports you'll also have the module type available and you can look up the named export of the module type and that'll be the type information you want.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",

I can't think of any reason that wouldn't be possible in theory, but I don't really feel comfortable enough with this corner of the code base to actually do that myself with confidence yet.
