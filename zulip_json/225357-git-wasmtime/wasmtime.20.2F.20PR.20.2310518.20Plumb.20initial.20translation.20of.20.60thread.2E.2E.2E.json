It is useful, though, to (1) exercise all the new table-related functions and (2) show the limits of Wasmtime's current state: we will need a way of interacting with shared functions and possibly some form of shared store.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

E.g., in the tests, for <code>(core type $start (shared (func (param $context i32))))</code>, we use <code>$start</code> as the index passed through to this canonical built-in. I see how to retrieve a <code>TypeFunc</code> using <code>ComponentTypes</code> but I don't think that's what we actually want here &mdash; that would be a component type. Is <code>TypeFuncIndex</code> the right index to be using here? How do we get to its core type (presumably backed by <code>VMSharedTypeIndex</code>)?</p>\n</blockquote>",

What I'm trying to do is plumb through enough to (a) show how this is currently possible using unshared tables (while still immediately failing) and (b) create a use site here so that future refactoring considers this usage. I was thinking that tests could even check for the initial behavior that _is_ functional today: i.e., we can't run a shared function, but at least we can check that using the wrong index results in a failure.</p>\n</blockquote>",
