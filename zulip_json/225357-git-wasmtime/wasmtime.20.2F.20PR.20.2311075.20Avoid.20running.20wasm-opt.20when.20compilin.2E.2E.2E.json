But even if that worked, I would still prefer to not run <code>wasm-opt</code>. I don't think tests should be changing behaviour based on whether <code>wasm-opt</code> happens to be in the path.</p>\n<p>I could add something to wasmtime to build a binary called <code>wasm-opt</code> which does nothing, and place that first in the path when building the test program.</p>\n<p>Or I could change my own system to avoid the problem, but that won't fix it for others.</p>\n</blockquote>",
