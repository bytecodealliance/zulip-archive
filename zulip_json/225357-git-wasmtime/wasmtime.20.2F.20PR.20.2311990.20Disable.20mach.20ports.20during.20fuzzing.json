I've got no idea why myself and it seems non-deterministic. Instead of trying to bottom this out I've gone ahead and just disabled mach ports during fuzzing. Mach ports are mainly there to play nice with Breakpad and such which isn't a concern during fuzzing, so using signals should work just as well.</p>\n<p>[here]: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11850#issuecomment-3493237271\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11850#issuecomment-3493237271</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
