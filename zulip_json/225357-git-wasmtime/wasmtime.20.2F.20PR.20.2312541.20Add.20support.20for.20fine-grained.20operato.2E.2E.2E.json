It also gives a nice uniformity between the custom and default cases (we just use our default table).</p>\n<p>One high-level issue with this design is that if one ever needs more custom logic that depends on other context -- e.g., adjust the cost of a <code>Call</code> based on what the call target is -- then that is a reasonably straightforward extension with a closure (take another argument with context, or the operand arguments) but not for a table-driven approach. I guess this design must still satisfy your use-case, but I wonder if any others are out there that would need the more generic one?</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm happy to land this as-is if it works for you, modulo a few small comments below.

With 627 opcodes currently and with 8-bytes-per-opcode here that's 5016 bytes for a structure that's an optional feature to move around and manage. That's not the end of the world per se, but it's something I think is worth considering as this is a costly data structure to manage.</p>\n<p>This also has the penalty of being serialized into all Wasmtime artifacts, meaning that all <code>*.cwasm</code>s would have this table baked in by-default even if it's not actually used. </p>\n<p>An upside of tables over closures, however, is that this is more easily serializable. Right now this isn't hooked up to the CLI, but this sort of leaves the door open for eventually doing that.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>that is a reasonably straightforward extension with a closure (take another argument with context, or the operand arguments) but not for a table-driven approach</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Another possible thing to consider here would be something like <code>memory.copy</code>.
