This fixes an issue where the component trampolines were not updated as part of #11592 to have a try/catch for errors that happen during their execution.</p>\n<p>The implementation here is intended to be a small, backportable, patch to the 38.0.x release branch. This does not refactor, for example, <code>TrampolineCompiler</code> which now always uses the <code>Wasm</code> ABI as opposed to using either the wasm or array ABI. Such cleanup is left for a follow-up PR to <code>main</code> after this one.</p>\n<p>In the meantime though the implementation of array-ABI component model intrinsics now looks exactly like array-to-wasm trampolines for core wasm where the array-ABI function performs a <code>try_call</code> to the wasm-ABI function, letting the wasm-ABI function doing the actual work. This is a nice simplification for trampolines where the definition of the trampoline is now just in one function instead of duplicated across two.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
