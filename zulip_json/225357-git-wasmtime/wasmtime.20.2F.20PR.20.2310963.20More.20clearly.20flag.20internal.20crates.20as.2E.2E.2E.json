Specifically:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many crates are renamed from <code>wasmtime-foo</code> to <code>wasmtime-internal-foo</code>.</li>\n<li>All of these crates now have <code>INTERNAL: ...</code> in their <a href=\"http://crates.io\">crates.io</a> description.</li>\n<li>All of these crates now have a warning at the top of their documentation discouraging use.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This change is a result of <a href=\"https://github.com/rustsec/advisory-db/issues/1999\">rustsec/advisory-db#1999</a> where the goal is to be crystal clear from a project perspective that usage of these crates are highly discouraged and not supported. We'll still probably get such advisories but we won't be considering them CVEs from the project itself due to the internal nature of these crates and the discouraging warnings.</p>\n<p>Some concrete changes used here are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inter-crate dependencies still use <code>wasmtime_foo</code> for naming and do so with Cargo's package-renaming features.</li>\n<li>Crate renames are specified at the workspace level so the rename is only in one locations and all other inherit it.</li>\n<li>Contribution documentation now has some brief guidelines about crate organization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
