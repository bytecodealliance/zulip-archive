While not literally present in those PRs it's my own personal conclusion that it's best to just go ahead and add these bounds at the \"base\" of the component trait hierarchy. The current implementation in #11123 adds bounds in many locations and this would remove the need to add bounds everywhere and instead have everything inherited through the <code>Lift</code> and <code>Lower</code> traits.</p>\n<p>This raises the question of: why? The main conclusion that I've reached leading to this change is that Wasmtime currently will store <code>R</code>, a return value, on the stack during the lowering process back into linear memory. This might involve allocation, however, meaning that wasm can be invoked and a context switch could happen. For Wasmtime's <code>unsafe impl</code> of <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> on fibers to be sound it requires that this stack-local variable is also <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> as it's an entirely user-provided type. Thus I've concluded that for results it's always required for these to be both <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> (or at the very least, <code>Send</code>).</p>\n<p>Given that I've gone ahead and updated to require both <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code> for both params and results. This is not expected to actually have any impact in practice since all primitives are already <code>Send</code>/<code>Sync</code> (minus <code>Rc</code> impls all removed here) and all <code>bindgen!</code>-generated types are compositions of <code>Send</code>/<code>Sync</code> primitives meaning that they're also <code>Send</code> and <code>Sync</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
