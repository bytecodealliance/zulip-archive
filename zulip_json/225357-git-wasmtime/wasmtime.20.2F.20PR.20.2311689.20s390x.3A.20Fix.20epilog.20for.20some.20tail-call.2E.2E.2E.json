It turns out that the<br>\nis_reg_saved_in_prologue routine did not handle the stack pointer correctly.</p>\n<p>Note that this only makes any difference for functions where cranelift common code includes the stack pointer in the list of clobbered registers passed to compute_frame_layout, which normally never happens as modifications to the stack pointer should be invisible to common code register tracking ...</p>\n<p>Fixes: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11602\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/11602</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
