This change means that when exceptions are used, for example, only the upper X registers need to be saved instead of the upper F registers as well. This mirrors the x64 ABI for example which clobbers all float registers on SystemV variants.</p>\n<p>The motivation for this commit is to shrink the generated bytecode for exception-using functions. Clobbering all X registers has special support in the <code>push_frame_save</code> and <code>pop_frame_restore</code> opcodes where the registers to save are a bitmask. With floats a separate instruction-per-register is needed. While it's possible to add a macro opcode to handle floats as well it was easier to update the ABI to match x64. Basically I figure that if the ABI is good enough for x64 it's probably fine for Pulley which already doesn't have great float performance (all float ops are \"extended opcodes\").</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
