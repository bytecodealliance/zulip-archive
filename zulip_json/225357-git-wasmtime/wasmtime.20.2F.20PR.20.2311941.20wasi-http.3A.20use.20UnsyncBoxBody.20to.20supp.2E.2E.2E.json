It is the same type, without the Sync constraint. The axum framework uses UnsyncBoxBody everywhere and is not compatible with the conversion functions in the p3 crate otherwise.</p>\n<p>Since axum already happily uses the UnsyncBoxBody internally, I would guess it is a reasonable choice to use here, but I am not sure.</p>\n<p>I tested code by running <code>cargo test --features=p3</code> in the wasi-http crate, and <code>cargo test all serve</code> for the CLI. I also got my own code locally to work against this branch and was able to forward an axum request to a wasm handler.</p>\n</blockquote>",
