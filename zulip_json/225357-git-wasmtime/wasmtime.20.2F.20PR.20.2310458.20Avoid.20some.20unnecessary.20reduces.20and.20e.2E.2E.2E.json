We were representing that value as a <code>u32</code>, and then to represent traps and panics, we packed that into a <code>u64</code> and if the <code>u64</code> was negative that meant there was a trap/panic but otherwise we could unpack the bottom half and that was our result.</p>\n<p>But because our GC refs are non-zero, we don't need to extend to a <code>u64</code> to get a sentinel for traps/panics; we can just use zero. That's what this commit does.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
