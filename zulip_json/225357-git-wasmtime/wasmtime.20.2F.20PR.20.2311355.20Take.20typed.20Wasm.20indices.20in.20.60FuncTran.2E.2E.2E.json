Those Wasm indices were previously passed as <code>u32</code>s, but are now typed indices (e.g. <code>MemoryIndex</code> instead of <code>u32</code>). This makes it more difficult to pass the wrong index to these methods.</p>\n<p>I also removed some unused arguments from a few <code>FuncEnvironment</code> methods that the results of <code>FuncTranslationState::get_*</code> calls were feeding into. These were left over from when <code>FuncEnvironment</code> was a trait and not a single type.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
