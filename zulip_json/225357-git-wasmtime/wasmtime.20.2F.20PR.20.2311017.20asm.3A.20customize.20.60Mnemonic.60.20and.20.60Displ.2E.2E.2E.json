But, as we're seeing in #10836 and elsewhere, other times we want to control the printing of the entire instruction--the full <code>Display</code> implementation. We'll need this kind of thing if we want to swap the order of operands or omit an immediate if it ends up being included in the printed instruction name.</p>\n<p>This change splits this kind of customization in two: <code>Mnemonic</code> and <code>Display</code>. After renaming this enum to <code>Customization</code>, all existing uses of <code>Display</code> are migrated to <code>Mnemonic</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
