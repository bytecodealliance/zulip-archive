The sqrtss and sqrtsd will be included in a follow-up patch. Those isle instructions use two operands as a special case with the explanation that data dependencies needed to be captured for the non-packed case. It's not clear that those dependencies were being captured by my patch so instead of blessing the file-test update, I removed support for those instructions to get support for these instructions pushed now to avoid constant rebasing. Will follow-up quickly with another patch for sqrtss and sqrtsd once the changes needed there are understood. </p>\n</blockquote>",
