This helps <code>wasmtime wizer</code> support wasm-tools-generated components which use nested components for type-ascribing exports. Otherwise though nested components are not allowed to defined or instantiate core modules as that would need more implementation in Wizer to support.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
