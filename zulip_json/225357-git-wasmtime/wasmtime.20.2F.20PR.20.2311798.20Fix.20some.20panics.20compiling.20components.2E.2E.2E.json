The issues were all related to resource types and how information wasn't registered ahead of time before it was translated from wasmparser's representation to Wasmtime's representation. The high-level cause for this had to do with how component and instance types are handled, as opposed to concrete components or instances themselves. This was effectively a hole in Wasmtime's translation process for components which has never been filled out since the original implementation of resources. The reason that this never came up before is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Most components don't currently import or export a component itself.</li>\n<li>Most components don't currently import or export component or instance types (as opposed to values).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One of these was required to trigger this issue. The solution implemented in this commit is to plumb the concept of an \"abstract resource\" which is part of a type but not actually ever used at runtime except for type equality during type reflection. This is expected to have little-to-no impact on real-world components given that these situations are rarely occurring.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
