In both cases, curl running on GitHub infrastructure, downloading from GitHub infrastructure, fetches 55124 bytes and then stalls. That number consistently comes up for the five retries in one curl invocation as well. I wonder if there's some underlying caching or file-serving bug in the GitHub asset CDN? In any case, I don't see anything we can really do here about it.</p>\n<p>Since it's a transiet network failure and not a true CI issue I'll go ahead and close.</p>\n</blockquote>",
