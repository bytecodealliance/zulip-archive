Put simply, Tapir added 3 new instructions to LLVM's IR to make it possible to express parallelism in code such that the various optimizers in the middle/back end could do intelligent things, and it looks like they got pretty good performance improvements by doing so.  Would it be worth considering adding these instructions to Cranelift's IR?  </p>\n</blockquote>",
