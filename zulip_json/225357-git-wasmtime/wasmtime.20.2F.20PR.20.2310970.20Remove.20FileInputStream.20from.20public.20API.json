If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;<br>\nI suspect based on looking <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime-wasi/33.0.0/wasmtime_wasi/p2/struct.FileInputStream.html\">at documentation for this struct</a> that this struct was never intended to be part of <code>wasmtime-wasi</code>'s public API. Particularly given that external crates do not have access to the <code>File</code> struct that its <a href=\"https://docs.rs/wasmtime-wasi/33.0.0/wasmtime_wasi/p2/struct.FileInputStream.html#method.new\"><code>new</code> method</a> expects as a parameter. The <code>File</code> struct is public within the module but it's not exported by the crate so consumers outside the crate cannot create an instance of this struct to pass as a parameter to <code>FileInputStream</code>'s <code>new</code> method. IMHO it's a bit confusing as a user of <code>wasmtime-wasi</code> for the type to exist on the public API if it isn't usable outside the crate.</p>\n</blockquote>",
