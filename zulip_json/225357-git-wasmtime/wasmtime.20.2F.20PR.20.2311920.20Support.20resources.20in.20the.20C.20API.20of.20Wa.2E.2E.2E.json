Support is effectively the same as in Rust except more things are behind pointers and <code>ResourceDynamic</code> is used under the hood instead of <code>Resource&lt;T&gt;</code> due to the lack of monomorphization. Tests have been updated to go through some various situations of ensuring that guest and host resources are representable and can be manipulated.</p>\n<p>Closes #11437<br>\n&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
