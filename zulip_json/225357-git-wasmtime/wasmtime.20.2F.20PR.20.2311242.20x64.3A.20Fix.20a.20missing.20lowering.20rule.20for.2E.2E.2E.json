This was reachable when explicit bounds checks are enabled from wasm, for example. The fix here is to handle the <code>And</code> condition in the same way that lowering <code>select</code> does which is to model that as it flows into the select helper.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
