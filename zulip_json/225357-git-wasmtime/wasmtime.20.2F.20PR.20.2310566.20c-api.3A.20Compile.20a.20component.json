We don't have many tests for the C API and right now they're all classified as examples rather than unit tests. They're also awkward to write because C is pretty awkward to write.</p>\n<p>To solve this one thing we've wanted to do was to fold the wasmtime-cpp repository (C++ bindings build on the C API) into this repository. That would make it much easier to write tests and then we could whip up some cmake as well to get tests.</p>\n<p>I know writing tests isn't the most glamorous thing but it's a major thing I'd personally like to see before much of the rest of the C API becomes load bearing because I think the conversion of values is going to be significantly trickier than the wasm C API and warrant more thorough testing.</p>\n</blockquote>",
