The fuzzer sometimes disables these flags in Cranelift but the SIMD Wast tests are marked as supported if the Rust standard library says the current CPU has AVX and AVX2 support. So when the fuzzer disables these flags, the test is still marked as supported and then fails with an error saying AVX or AVX2 is required when the test is executed.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Figuring out how to navigate the fuzzers around this I always find a bit of a challenge. For example I thought we <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/cd67a6090d515189a9c286bec2d993a591da3739/crates/fuzzing/src/generators/config.rs#L582\">already disabled the simd proposal for winch</a>, so how come Winch got some simd instructions?</p>\n<p>Once we know simd is in the picture it also might make more sense to either accept this as a \"this is allowed error\" or fail earlier during the test case itself. We try to keep the fuzz test cases meaning the same thing across machines so instead of force-enabling AVX it might make more sense to see if AVX is either explicitly disabled or unavailable on hardware and in that case bail out and discard the fuzz test case basically</p>\n</blockquote>",

Specifically <code>wast_tests</code> fails because fuzz configuration is turning off <code>has_avx</code> (explicitly) and then running a simd test. The host actually has avx though which is why the test is expected to pass but then it fails because <code>has_avx</code> is manually disabled otherwise.</p>\n<p>I'm wary to force-enable <code>has_avx</code> in such a core location in fuzzing because it'll mean we basically never fuzz Winch without AVX which seems useful to preserve. Would it be possible to perhaps scope this to just the <code>wast_tests</code> fuzzer and that one oracle? That could test for Winch, see if the test itself needs simd (which I think is available in configuration), and then the fuzz input could be thrown out (aka skipped) if avx is explicitly disabled?</p>\n</blockquote>",
