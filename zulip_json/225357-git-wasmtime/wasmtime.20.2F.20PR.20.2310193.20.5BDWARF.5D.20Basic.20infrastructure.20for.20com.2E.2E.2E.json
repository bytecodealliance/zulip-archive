It is very easy to install the additional WASM pieces if they're missing. In comparison, this C/C++ setup is much more complex - you need to procure the (correct) WASI SDK and need to understand what <code>WASI_SDK_PATH</code> is. So it's very \"different\" from that perspective.<br>\n2) It has potentially better build time characteristics. While currently the debug tests are under the all-encompassing <code>all</code> target, I want to move them to a separate test target, so that they're quicker to build. In such a scheme, the <code>--test=all</code> workflow won't need to build the C/C++ assets at all.</p>\n<p>And I couldn't find clear downsides, beside the inherent cost of adding one more crate. But it seems in Rust it is not unusual to have a large number of crates.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I would agree that if this were folded in then we wouldn't want to have it required by default due to build requirements, and there's generally no issue with extra crates. That being said though what I'm concerned about here is that there's multiple locations building guest wasm programs. We already have <code>crates/test-programs/artifacts/build.rs</code> doing the bulk of the work and there's even already <code>crates/test-programs/src/bin/dwarf_*</code> for various rust programs with debuginfo.</p>\n<p>What I'd sort of hope for is to have C/C++ not be so special at least at a surface level, ideally we could create <code>crates/test-programs/src/bin/*.{c,cpp}</code> and that'd automatically get picked up and built. That'd additionally hook into teh rest of the support to, for example, create components for C/C++ modules as well which might be useful in the future.</p>\n<p>The primary concern of build time I think might be mitigatable by gracefully handling when <code>WASI_SDK_PATH</code> isn't built and skipping the builds/tests or something like that. For example in addition to a static slice (which would be empty if the compile didn't happen) a static bool could be generated saying whether it was actually compiled. Then the <code>#[ignore]</code>'d tests would assert the boolean before executing.</p>\n</blockquote>",
