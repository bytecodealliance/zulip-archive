This PR creates variants of a bunch of these internal functions that drops their <code>print_</code> prefix and has them return String instead of append to self.src. This is probably worse for performance, but I assume it just doesn't matter for a code generator inside a proc macro.</p>\n<p>The existing imperative apis (those starting with <code>print_</code>) still exist, except in the cases where they were dead code- that is, they were only used by other imperative code that was translated to the functional style.</p>\n</blockquote>",
