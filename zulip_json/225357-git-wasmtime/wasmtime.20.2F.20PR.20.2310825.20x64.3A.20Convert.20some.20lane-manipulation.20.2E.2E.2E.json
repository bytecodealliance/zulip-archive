This needed some extra treatment/helpers in the ISLE integration to ensure that this was all hooked up correctly from ISLE constructors down to the assembler instructions.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

I struggled a bit over how this emits ISLE for write-only reg-mem operands; when and how we are emitting certain things can get a bit confusing (e.g., how we're intermixing this all with the trap codes). I concluded, though, that this is creating the constructors we would expect, even if it isn't particularly clear. And we can always refactor this later. Thanks for figuring this stuff out!</p>\n</blockquote>",
