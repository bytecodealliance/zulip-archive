In other words, when a user of this assembler is encoding an instruction, they should have the ability to decide not only which opmask register to use (<code>k0</code>-<code>k7</code>) but also to select if they want the \"merging-masking\" or \"zeroing-masking\" behavior (section 2.7.4 in the manual). So this <code>bool</code> field would need to be present on the generated instruction <code>struct</code>, not here in the DSL.</p>\n<p>This raises some questions, though, about how to handle these \"options\" on an instruction:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>for opmask registers, we probably want some way to use <code>k0</code> by default, which does no masking at all; other, than this, opmask registers act pretty much like other operands (no regalloc, though)</li>\n<li>for masking behavior, we do not want them to act like other operands &mdash; this flag isn't an operand at all! I propose we encode the default behavior in <code>EVEX.z</code> and open an issue to figure out a good way to expose this kind of flag on instructions. Why? Because...</li>\n<li>for vector lengths, we actually want the ability to select the length as one of these flags (<code>L128</code>, <code>L256</code>, <code>L512</code>). Right now we fix this in the DSL but, if we had a way to expose flags, we would want instruction lengths to parameterize the instruction.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But all of that does not need to be figured out in this PR. I propose we just default to using <code>k0</code> and ignore the masking behavior here and open an issue to solve this later.</p>\n</blockquote>",
