The reason this was allowed was that when the workspace was first migrated the Wasmtime crate had too many instances that I was willing to fix. I've now come back around and tried to fix everything.</p>\n<p>In short: ideally delete <code>#[allow]</code>, otherwise use <code>#[expect]</code>, otherwise use <code>#[allow]</code>.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
