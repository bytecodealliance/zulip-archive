The goal here is to enable Wasmtime to compile for architectures that it has no prior knowledge of. There's a few miscellaneous locations through Wasmtime where we need architecture-specific intrinsics and such but that's all in service of Cranelift itself. Without Cranelift support none of them are necessary.</p>\n<p>This commit plumbs a custom <code>#[cfg]</code> from Wasmtime's <code>build.rs</code> script into the crate about whether there's a supported Cranelift backend. If this isn't available some architecture-specific intrinsics are turned off and not included. An example is that <code>vm::arch</code> entirely disappears which is only in service of <code>UnwindHost</code>, which also disappears. Furthermore the <code>helpers.c</code> file also entirely disappears as it's not necessary on unknown architectures.</p>\n<p>To help keep this working I've added CI to build Wasmtime for <code>powerpc64le-unknown-linux-gnu</code>. Wasmtime currently has no support for this architecture, although if it grows such support in the future this'll need to be changed to some other unsupported architecture.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Nontrivial changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Validation of <code>Tunables</code> for execution at runtime is deferred until a module is loaded. This enables 32-bit platforms, which disable <code>signals_based_traps</code>, to compile for 64-bit platforms (e.g. the <code>disas</code> test suite)</li>\n<li>Auto-configuration of <code>Tunables</code> based on crate features is skipped if <code>--target</code> is passed. This fixes <code>disas</code> cross-compilation tests from 32-to-64-bit where 64-bit hosts expect <code>signals-based-traps</code>.</li>\n<li>Some standalone <code>tests/*.rs</code> files have moved from <code>/tests/*.rs</code> to <code>/crates/wasmtime/tests/*.rs</code> to be able to use the <code>#[cfg]</code> directives printed by <code>crates/wasmtime/build.rs</code></li>\n<li>Default Tunables for Pulley targets have been auto-adjusted to assume no signals-based-traps and no memory reservation. This fixes <code>--target pulley32</code> on 32-bit platforms where the second bullet above wasn't otherwise applying to auto-disable from the defaults.</li>\n<li>Stack overflow messages for overflowing the async stack no longer happen with Pulley. That's because we no longer (intentionally) install signal handlers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Juggling compile options I feel still isn't great. Ideally everything \"just works\" but it's a narrow needle to thread trying to juggle different crate features and targetting different environments. Ideally we'd be able to query <code>has_native_signals</code> and <code>has_virtual_memory</code> based on <code>target_lexicon::Triple</code>, but that involves inferring <code>cfg(unix)</code> or <code>cfg(windows)</code> which is a bit of a stretch at this time. I've attempted to have at least a somewhat reasonable middle-ground in the meantime.</p>\n</blockquote>",
