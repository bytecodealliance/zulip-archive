That may change the lock file if the crates weren't previously vendored, so this enables using the network to fetch dependencies in the lock file that aren't present locally.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",

We do want to hit the network to fill out any packages that are in the lock file but not present locally, and Cargo by deafult, when updating versions, keeps the old lock file as much as possible. Given that it should be fine to drop <code>--offline</code> and when updating versions it shouldn't update versions of other unrelated dependencies. Did you see different behavior though?</p>\n</blockquote>",
