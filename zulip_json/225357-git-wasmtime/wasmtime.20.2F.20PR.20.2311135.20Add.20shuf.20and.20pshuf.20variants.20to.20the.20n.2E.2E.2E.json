Adding it makes it consistent with what is there now. It seems we've kept this AVX enum intact here and here: cranelift/codegen/src/isa/x64/inst/args.rs . Perhaps we are able too delete these avx instructions from both these files but vshufpd wouldn't be the only one .. pack, align, insert, phadd, etc all would need removing and so perhaps we can do that all at once?</p>\n</blockquote>",
