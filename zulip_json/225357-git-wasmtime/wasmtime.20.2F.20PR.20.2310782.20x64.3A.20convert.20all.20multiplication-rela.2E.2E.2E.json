This PR converts all x64 backend multiplications to use the new assembler and, in doing so, adds support for implicit registers: these are operands that need to be tracked during register allocation but may not show up in instruction disassembly. There is more that _could_ be done to refactor these multiplication rules but that could come later.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I did put up #10775, but I'm not really sure if it helps all that much. Another option to avoid these extra conversions would be to wrap up  the <code>i32</code> in a <code>RegMemImm.Imm</code> and then immediately unwrap it, but that confuses the type declaration. Not sure what to do, but it seems this is ripe for some refactoring...</p>\n</blockquote>",

That seems like it could create a pretty surprising situation where an instruction uses an vreg operand but it doesn't show up in the disassembly.</p>\n<p>Would it be possible to skip printing the operands post-regalloc but print them, maybe in a comment, pre-regalloc?</p>\n</blockquote>",
