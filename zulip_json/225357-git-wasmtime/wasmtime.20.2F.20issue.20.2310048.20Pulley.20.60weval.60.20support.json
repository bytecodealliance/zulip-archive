However, as you pointed out, weval might not be ready for that sort of process yet. That could probably be split out into a more long-term project (requiring inlining in both our waffles, among other optimizations).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I suspect there might be an X-Y problem at play here: what is the end goal you're driving toward?

This distances the component model from a standard, and  incurs seperate projects like <code>pit</code> and alternate, witx-using, WASI forks like WASIX to support more runtimes. Compiling components to core WASM would allow interaction with those core-wasm-using systems, in addition to allow running on underpowered systems where a further compiler is required.</p>\n<p>Embedding Wasmtime, and further on, <code>weval</code> support, may solve this, but seems to be too much work, and I understand that. However, our ABIs can be bridged; a wip version of one can be found as the <code>pit</code> WIT bridge (note that it uses my fork of waffle). We could split that goal of compiling components to core WASM into another issue (possibly somewhere else?). Feel free to close and reopen when ready.</p>\n</blockquote>",

My main point is only that I think partially evaluating a Wasm interpreter over a Wasm module is quite an indirect and brittle path to get a module inside a component to pop out the other side; and moreover from a planning point of view I don't want to put \"make weval good enough to make that pipeline invisible\" on the critical path of such a useful tool idea.</p>\n</blockquote>",
