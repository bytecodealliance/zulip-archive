The allocation/vmctx infrastructure was additionally refactored to be shared for both core and component instances since they behave the exact same way anyway. This further enables sharing various methods like <code>vmctx_plus_offset</code> which are pretty unsafe internally.</p>\n<p>Like #10943 this necessitated removal of <code>Index</code> implementations because <code>IndexMut</code> is not compatible with the returned type being <code>Pin&lt;&amp;mut T&gt;</code> so they were replaced by inherent <code>get</code> and <code>get_mut</code> methods on the component instance id type.</p>\n<p>Closes #10933</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
