It's generated by <code>gen_arguments_method</code> here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/CraneStation/cranelift/blob/master/lib/codegen/meta-python/gen_instr.py#L60\">https://github.com/CraneStation/cranelift/blob/master/lib/codegen/meta-python/gen_instr.py#L60</a></p>\n<p>Currently, there are several possible formats for instructions, so it does a <code>match</code> to determine how to retrieve the arguments slice. In practice, it's compiled to an indirect jump with a table.</p>\n<p>It would be interesting to experiment with making all instructions use a <code>ValueList</code>, rather than just using <code>ValueList</code> for variable-length argument lists. That might use a little more memory, but it might speed up <code>arguments</code> by making it avoid the jump table.</p>\n</blockquote>",
