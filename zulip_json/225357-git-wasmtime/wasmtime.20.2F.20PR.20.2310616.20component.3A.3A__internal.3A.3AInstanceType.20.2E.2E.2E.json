This is used during lifting/lowering of <code>ResourceAny</code> (transitively through the <code>resource_type</code> helper method which delegates to this one). I'd prefer to keep the <code>Arc</code>-cloning off the hot path there if possible, but I need to read up more on the other PR for better understanding the motivation behind this one. </p>\n</blockquote>",

If for some reason the approach you outlined in #10610 doesn't cash out I will at very least make sure we can amortize the clone to only happen once per store, so it doesn't hurt resource lifting/lowering.</p>\n</blockquote>",
