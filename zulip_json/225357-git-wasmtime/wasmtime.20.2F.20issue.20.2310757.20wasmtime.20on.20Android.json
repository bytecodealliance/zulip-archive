This can run perfectly on an Android ARM64v8a device and load the wasm artifacts generated by Kotlin/wasi. On Android, it loads these wasm artifacts via wasmtime and calls functions from the wasm file. It's currently under development. The plan is to support the Kotlin Multiplatform platform after JNI integration, enabling bidirectional RPC communication. Android already supports this, and support will be added for Windows, macOS, and Linux. iOS requires implementation via Kotlin/native and will need debugging. You can check the main2 branch, which is currently being updated; it will be removed and reconfigured later.</p>\n<p>Additionally, on Android, the minimum file size cannot be used; a full-featured artifact should be implemented, supporting AOT and JIT. The configuration also differs from desktop.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/crowforkotlin/wasmline/tree/main2\">https://github.com/crowforkotlin/wasmline/tree/main2</a></p>\n<p>![Image](<a href=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51da983b-8c67-496e-b550-be7556587cd6\">https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51da983b-8c67-496e-b550-be7556587cd6</a>)</p>\n</blockquote>",
