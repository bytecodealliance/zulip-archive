Should be able to <code>(assert_trap (invoke ...) \"the message\")</code> and that makes the tests much easier to run and avoids compiling more Rust code for tests</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>_Originally posted by @alexcrichton in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11751#discussion_r2426838777_\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11751#discussion_r2426838777_</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
