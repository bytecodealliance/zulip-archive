These functions started being more heavily used after historical refactorings such as #10877 so this helps benchmarks which access linear memory in host functions, for example.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
