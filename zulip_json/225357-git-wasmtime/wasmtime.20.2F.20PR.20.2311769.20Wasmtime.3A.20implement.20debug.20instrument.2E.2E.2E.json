This is forced by the<br>\n  current design of <code>Backtrace</code>, which takes a closure and walks that<br>\n  closure over stack frames eagerly (rather than work as an<br>\n  iterator). It's got some impressive iterator-chain stuff going on<br>\n  internally, so refactoring it to the latter approach might not<br>\n  be <em>too</em> bad, but I haven't tackled it yet.</p>\n<p>A O(1) stack view, that is, one that does work only for frames as<br>\nthe host API is used to walk up the stack, is desirable because some<br>\nuse-cases may want to quickly examine e.g. only the deepest<br>\nframe (say, running with a breakpoint condition that needs to read a<br>\nparticular local's value after each step).</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It includes a new <code>Config::compiler_force_inlining()</code> option that is<br>\n  used only for testing that we get the correct frames after<br>\n  inlining. I couldn't get the existing flags to work on a Wasmtime<br>\n  config level and suspect there may be an existing bug there; I will<br>\n  try to split out a fix for it.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This PR renames the existing <code>debug</code> option to <code>native_debug</code>, to<br>\ndistinguish it from the new approach.</p>\n<p>(Stacked on #11768.)</p>\n<p>[recent RFC]: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/44\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/44</a></p>\n</blockquote>",

The borrowing is a little tricky but does work out: we implement a custom iterator up the stack frames (<code>StackView</code>), which owns the store while alive, and a mutable borrow of that iterator must be passed into methods on the objects it returns (<code>FrameView</code>) to actually read values. All of that gives a safe, lazy (<code>O(1)</code>) way of walking the stack.</p>\n<p>In #11783 (underlying iterator that this refactor used) I chose not to replicate all of the complex logic to walk all activations and continuation stack-chains; for now, this API walks only the last activation that entered the host. That seems sufficient for a basic debugger application to me, but I can update it as desired.</p>\n<p>This is now stacked on #11768 and #11783, and depends on the just-filed #11784 to be resolved somehow.</p>\n</blockquote>",

And there are weird corner cases where, for example, the recursively invoked host code itself tries to set up a (nested) debug context that we'd want to rule out anyway.

I agree that as written this API permits those patterns; I had been mostly concerned with keeping the stack \"frozen\" with the <code>StackView</code> iterator, then realized that the <code>Store</code> needs to be kept separate from whatever the iterator yields (because you cannot yield a <code>&amp;mut _</code> more than once from an iterator if they overlap, and the alternative would otherwise be to have the store mut-borrow be reborrowed by <code>FrameView</code>, but that's not viable here).</p>\n<p>I suspect that the easiest sound option may be to give up on providing an actual iterator, that literally yields externalizable values (<code>FrameView</code>) for each frame, but rather integrate the reading-of-the-frame methods into the <code>StackView</code> itself. That cleanly disallows any of the \"save it for later\" or \"use it with the wrong store\" cases because the <code>StackView</code> holds the store borrow.</p>\n<p>It does mean a user would look something like</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"k\">while</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">!</span><span class=\"n\">stack_view</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">done</span><span class=\"p\">()</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">{</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">instance</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">stack_view</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">instance</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">func</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">stack_view</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">defined_func_index</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">value</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">stack_view</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">local</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">);</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"c1\">// ...</span>\n<span class=\"w\">  </span><span class=\"n\">stack_view</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">move_up</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n<span class=\"p\">}</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>What do you think?</p>\n</blockquote>",

This is important because we get the specific type from the validator's view of the Wasm state and it only makes sense to query that after the operator translation has updated the stack completely to match the current program point, rather than at each individual push/pop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The last one is the most fundamental, the other two are \"only\" big mechanical refactors, but for all these reasons I think the current approach is the most workable (and the doc-comment here does a not terrible job explaining the invariant imho).</p>\n</blockquote>",

I was naively thinking \"no\" because locals can have a more refined type as well as values on the stack. Effectively the wasm validator understands a local/stack entry to have a particular type, and the runtime value may be that type or a subtype. Mutating the stack should allow anything that's a subtype of the known type, but by only recording the top type here we lose the knowledge of precisely what type it needs to be.</p>\n<p>I suppose bringing it back to this PR: I would be surprised if <code>FrameValType</code> continues to support future use cases as-is. In the end what I might naively expect is that <code>FrameValType</code> becomes literally <code>WasmValType</code>.

However, I don't think this will actually be an issue in practice because</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each stack map is already a packed bitmap, minimizing the effect of <code>num_live_gc_refs</code> to a degree</li>\n<li><code>num_live_gc_refs</code> is not actually large in practice</li>\n<li><code>num_safepoints</code> is only large when debugging in practice</li>\n<li>All of this only affects code size in edge cases, not run time performance</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But if we <em>are</em> concerned about this when adding debugging instrumentation's stack map entries, then I think we should also be concerned about stack maps as they exist today. It is certainly already possible to construct a Wasm that just does a ton of calls (making <code>num_safepoints</code> grow) with a ton of live GC refs on the stack. So if we are concerned about this, then we should make the stack maps in general have prefix sharing similar to what you've done for debug info. (Also I'm sure it is also possible to construct Wasm inputs that have similar Wasm:native code size blow ups in general due to Cranelift being an optimizing/non-template compiler with remat, demand-based egraph elaboration in the face of conditional branches, etc.)</p>\n<p>But I don't really want to keep holding up your debugging work, especially since you have so many PRs stacked on top of this one already. So if you still prefer the previous approach, then go for it. I won't draw any lines in the sand here.</p>\n</blockquote>",
