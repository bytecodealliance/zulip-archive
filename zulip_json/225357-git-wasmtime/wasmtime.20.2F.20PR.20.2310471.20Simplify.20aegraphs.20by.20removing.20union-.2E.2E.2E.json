It's an awful lot of complexity and has led to some fairly subtle bugs (e.g., #6126), and is generally unsatisfying.</p>\n<p>I had the realization: the only case where the distinction between canonical and latest ID matters is when we expand an eclass after its initial (eager) rewriting, which happens before we see its uses. If we hypothesize that this happens rarely, then it should be fine to canonicalize based only on latest ID -- we shouldn't lose much (and we can measure this loss empirically).</p>\n<p>The chief case where this kind of \"late eclass expansion\" still happens is: if we have some expression E1 that eventually rewrites to E2 via some simplification, and E2 already exists earlier in the program, then E1 will join the eclass. If we then have some <code>E3 := E1 + 1</code>, and later <code>E4 := E2 + 1</code>, we need the union-find canonicalization for E4 to GVN to E3. Otherwise, the latest ID for the eclass that eventually contains E1 and E2 is different at the time that E3 uses it (and is GVN'd and rewritten) and when E4 does. Put another way: E3 captures a snapshot of its operand's eclass before a new node joins it, and is never reprocessed when that happens, so E3 remains distinct.</p>\n<p>But if the <code>E2 -&gt; E1</code> rewrite is truly \"directional\" toward a better representation that we will always want to choose -- say, <code>x + 0 -&gt; x</code>, or any constant-propagation in general -- then if the eager rewriting for E2 produces E1's eclass ID directly <em>without</em> adding E2 to its nodes, then all users will still canonicalize as before. This \"only return the rewrite target, don't union with it\" before is exactly our <code>subsume</code> operator.</p>\n<p>Put another way: subsumption prevents growing eclasses later, so snapshots in time remain the latest, and everyone canonicalizes with the same ID. We move to a true immutable data structure, with simple hashconsing with no magic.</p>\n<p>The rewrite semantics are then much simpler too: if any value is marked \"subsume\", we pick it (pick an arbitrary one if multiple) as our rewrite result; otherwise, create an eclass with the original rewrite input and all rewrite outputs (by creating union-nodes in the DFG). No auto-subsume or factoring in availability -- that's it. \"Subsume\" means: always pick the rewritten value, don't keep the original, and we use it whenever that's unambiguously true for better canonicalization.</p>\n<p>Given that, it turns out that we can remove the union-find mechanism entirely. It also turns out that we can unify the scoped-hashmap for \"effectful/idempotent ops\" with the ordinary hashmap for pure ops; everything can be scoped. To get working LICM we do need to retain our \"available block\" mechanism, but only to insert values at a higher scope level in the scoped hashmap -- it is now heuristic, not load-bearing for correctness.</p>\n<p>I suspect that the fixpoint loop computing analysis results can go away too, now that we truly don't update arguments -- we have a simple immutable data structure with everything snapshotted at creation -- but I haven't made that change yet.</p>\n<p>This change appears to be \"in the noise\" in both runtime and compile time -- a Sightglass run on the default suite shows

Spot-checking the aegraph stats on the same function before-and-after shows the same optimizations happening in all functions I examined, and we see the compile-tests showing no movement except for a value renumbering in one case.
