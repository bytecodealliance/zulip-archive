Explicit traps can still use the full TrapCode range.</p>\n<p>The implementation is a bit awkward but I've added exhaustive tests for the encoding part. Feel free to close this PR if the cons (panic in <code>MemFlags::with_trap_code</code>) outweigh the pros here (more flexibility with dynamically-assigned user traps). :slightly_smiling_face: </p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

E.g., we may want the ability to turn a <code>trapif</code> into a virtual memory-based trap (which would use a load with <code>MemFlags</code>); that transform/optimization would no longer be possible with this distinction.</p>\n<p>If the change were to make trap codes, say, 32 or 64 bits, I could understand the utility better, but u16 is still small enough that one has to worry about running out if one is allocating these codes dynamically. Could you clarify your use-case and requirements? Maybe there's another way to encode the information that you're encoding in the trap code?</p>\n</blockquote>",

In my case the amount of unique errors roughly matches the amount of basic blocks in a source function.</p>\n<p>I'm handling these through signals and Cranelift's ability to resolve the trapping instruction back to an IR-level trap code is quite useful here. Of course I could also call into a function that raises a passed code from the generated assembly, but I'm not sure if there's a way that is as _code_-space efficient.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Given the niche use-case and the. impact to clean/generic IR design I'm going to go ahead and close this PR; thanks again for the suggestion, though.</p>\n</blockquote>",
