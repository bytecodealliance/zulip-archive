Next on the chopping block is component instances as they feed into a number of other locations. This work is split across a number of commits to be more bite-sized as the integration of <code>InstanceData</code> was a bit sprawling. With this removal some other refactorings are now unblocked to use more first-class index types within a Store and eventual removal of <code>Stored</code> entirely with its final user, component functions.</p>\n</blockquote>",
