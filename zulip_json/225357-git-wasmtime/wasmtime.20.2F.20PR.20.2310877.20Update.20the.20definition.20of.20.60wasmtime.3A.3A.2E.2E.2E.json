This means that converting from a Wasmtime-internal representation of a memory to an external representation of a memory is largely a noop and no longer requires an allocation. This is intended to be more useful in the future to use the public types more pervasively inside of Wasmtime itself, but for now this is mostly the scaffolding necessary for such a change.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
