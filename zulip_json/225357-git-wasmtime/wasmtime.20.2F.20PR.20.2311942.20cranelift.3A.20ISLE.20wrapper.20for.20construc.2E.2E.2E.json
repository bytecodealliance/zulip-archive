Not clear to me that splatting is the best default for vectors, or if we should always take a 128-bit value and reinterpret it as the vector type, or even if we should have a default constant constructor for vector types. Either way, I think the explicit splatting in the old version was clearer here.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Given that the purpose of #6038 is to unify the usage of different constant types, but we observed the unnecessary complexity in this PR if we include float/vec, do you think our goal will need to be changed to: replace <code>iconst</code> to some general int type or just change the <code>iconst</code> usage to allow handling different ints like you demonstrated here, to avoid working on <code>u64</code> directly?</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">subsume</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">my_const</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ty</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">u64_wrapping_sub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">k1</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">k2</span><span class=\"p\">)))</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>I will take a closer look soon.

This is because we generate the constructors for all CLIF opcodes in <code>build.rs</code> and <code>iconst</code> is one of those, so it is not easy to change in practice. Easier to add a new helper that calls out to <code>iconst</code> under the covers.</p>\n</blockquote>",
