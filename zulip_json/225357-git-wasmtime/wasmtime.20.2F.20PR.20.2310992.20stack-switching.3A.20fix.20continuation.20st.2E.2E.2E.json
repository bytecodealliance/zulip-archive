The <code>chunks</code> iterator call ends up skipping elements and the <code>windows</code> call would require pulling in something like <code>itertools::zip_longest</code> to work, so I just restored an impl closer to the original (but with more fine-grained unsafe calls).</p>\n<p>This code has coverage but only in the final round of stack switching changes.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Original Discussion: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10388#discussion_r2114747895\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/10388#discussion_r2114747895</a>.
