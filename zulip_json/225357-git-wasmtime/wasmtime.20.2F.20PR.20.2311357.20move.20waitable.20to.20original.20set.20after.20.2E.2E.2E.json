However, they may have been members of another set before we joined them to <code>sync_call_set</code>, in which case we need to move them back when we're done (or at least remove them from <code>sync_call_set</code>).</p>\n<p>Prior to this fix, we would panic when dropping a task which had subtasks which had been synchronously cancelled.  I've updated <code>async_cancel_callee.rs</code> to cover that case.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
