It also adds opaque descriptor blobs carried with stackslots. Together, these two features allow decorating IR with first-class debug instrumentation that is properly preserved by the compiler, including across optimizations and inlining. (Wasmtime's use of these features will come in followup PRs.)</p>\n<p>The key idea of a \"debug tag\" is to allow the Cranelift embedder to express whatever information it needs to, in a format that is opaque to Cranelift itself, except for the parts that need translation during lowering. In particular, the <code>DebugTag::StackSlot</code> variant gets translated to a physical offset into the stackframe in the compiled metadata output. So, for example, the embedder can emit a tag referring to a stackslot, and another describing an offset in that stackslot.</p>\n<p>The debug tags exist as a <em>sequence</em> on any given instruction; the meaning of the sequence is known only to the embedder, <em>except</em> that during inlining, the tags for the inlining call instruction are prepended to the tags of inlined instructions. In this way, a canonical use-case of tags as describing original source-language frames can preserve the source-language view even when multiple functions are inlined into one.</p>\n<p>The descriptor on a stackslot may look a little odd at first, but its purpose is to allow serializing some description of stackslot-contained runtime user-program data, in a way that is firmly attached to the stackslot. In particular, in the face of inlining, this descriptor is copied into the inlining (parent) function from the inlined function when the stackslot entity is copied; no other metadata outside Cranelift needs to track the identity of stackslots and know about that motion. This fits nicely with the ability of tags to refer to stackslots; together, the embedder can annotate instructions as having certain state in stackslots, and describe the format of that state per stackslot.</p>\n<p>This infrastructure is tested with some compile-tests now; testing of the interpretation of the metadata output will come with end-to-end debug instrumentation tests in a followup PR.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

This is currently a map of <code>Inst</code> to <code>Vec&lt;DebugTag&gt;</code>, but that appears to be mostly it. I'm surprised by that where I was expecting some sort of integration with egraphs or something like that. Because otherwise wouldn't egraphs basically destroy the usefulness of the debug tags where instructions are remapped/moved/etc? I realize for debugging in Wasmtime we'd disable egraphs, but if the handling is so light in Cranelift I'm also not certain why this can't be an embedder-only thing vs needing to be baked into Cranelift.</p>\n</blockquote>",

In particular, inlining concatenates tags from the inlining call instruction to those of the inlined instructions (see <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11768/files#diff-3650351ec5e041ebf66bb8e7abbde58ca2fc89bbd0e281a095672424cdada8b5R1\">this doc comment</a>); this is what means we need a list of tags, rather than a single tag, and the need for these tags to stand alone (rather than be an indirect index into some other data) is forced by inlining as well.</li>\n<li>The correctness across optimizations is ensured by placing tags on side-effectful instructions, which don't get removed. In the sibling PR for Wasmtime (#11769) I add them on all trapping instructions, and on callsites; an earlier iteration of this work put them on sequence-point instructions that acted as explicit immovable markers instead. I explained the appeal of that latter design for conceptual clarity in the meeting and we agreed to go back to sequence-point instructions (calls will also need tags, so the inlining mechanism works).</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",

Inlining \"just works\" when the <code>StackSlotData</code> is self-describing. Now we need to carry the side-table on the wasmtime-cranelift side, let <code>cranelift-codegen</code> query callees and decide to inline via the <code>Inline</code> trait, but insert a side-effect somehow enacted by that trait's implementation to move descriptors behind the scenes back on the <code>wasmtime-cranelift</code> side. That seems very error-prone in comparison. (Note that because we implement a per-function compiler, there is no place for a single module-global side-table to exist and be updated by the parallel compilation.)</li>\n<li>It's not any more efficient (we still are copying data from <code>FuncEnvironment</code> into the side-table, then between functions' side-tables when inlining). IIRC this was the original concern -- \"too Vec-heavy\" in some sense; but the descriptors still exist, just at arm's length and in a remote place that has to remain synchronized.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My wip branch is <a href=\"https://github.com/cfallin/wasmtime/commit/a2fd80c197fd09d58c5edf63a417c7a931e277a9\">here</a> for anyone curious but I didn't finish wiring up the part that actually queries/uses the descriptors; stopped when I realized what I would have to do in the <code>InliningCompiler</code>.</p>\n<p>I pretty strongly feel that the way it worked before was simpler, more self-contained, and more maintainable; this approach is pushed in a bad direction by high-level feedback that may not have foreseen all the implications.

For example you say:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>simpler, more self-contained, and more maintainable</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>but following this to the extreme means that we throw away the ability to embed Cranelift anywhere else and fuse it to Wasmtime specifically. That will objectively simplify Cranelift and make it more self-contained for Wasmtime's use case for example. Despite this though I don't think it makes sense to do, so this is part of a gray area of sorts where I thinks it's worth exploring solutions that avoid tacking on Wasmtime-specific features into Cranelift.</p>\n<p>The reason I feel this is Wasmtime-specific is how this relates to other Cranelift features feels different. For example <code>UserExternalName</code> is heavily used by Wasmtime and is just an opaque 64-bit integer effectively from Cranelift's point of view. It would objectively be simpler if we didn't have to deal with this and just moved <code>FuncKey</code> directly into Cranelift, but I view it as valuable that we don't do that. Having a tight API boundary is also nice for future compatibility/extensibility in that it makes working on Cranelift, outside the context of Wasmtime, easier.</p>\n<p>This is my high-level motivation at least which I wanted to explain. I'm not intentionally trying to make this harder to work with but basically trying to maintain a separation between Wasmtime and Cranelift. This is of course, as with everything, a balance to figure out what works and what doesn't. I don't want to over-rotate on \"they must be separate\" but I also don't want to over-rotate on \"this works let's just ship it\".</p>\n<hr>\n<p>For this problem specifically, I could very well be missing details, but I was under the impression that the idea was to tack a 64-bit integer/value/etc onto a <code>Descriptor</code>. That'd be the serialization of <code>FuncKey</code> which means, at the end of compilation, we know what origin function a stack slot corresponds to. What I was then thinking would happen is that <code>CompiledFunction</code> in Cranelift would retain metadata describing the stack slot (locals, etc). During the linking phase we'd need to build the metadata section in the ELF, and we'd use Cranelift's <code>MachBuffer</code> output to find what stack slots a function has. We'd then use this <code>FuncKey</code> to look up in the map of all functions to go to the metadata that the function wants, and then the section would be emitted.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's horribly complex to keep the side table and plumb it to the right places on the wasmtime-cranelift side</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Along the lines of my initial comment here, I want to reiterate that I'm not trying to make things horribly complex. If they are then they are and we should go a different route. </p>\n<p>For now though I'm not sure myself at least why inlining would come into play given that there's a stack-slot-per-function that's significant so the descriptor is the <code>FuncKey</code> for that function. I'm also not sure why carrying around the side table would be difficult if the per-function metadata were placed into a <code>CompiledFunction</code> and then looked up during the final linking phase.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>It's not any more efficient</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In some sense we've long since given up on this level of efficiency. There's a ton of inefficiencies in the \"don't clone this\" or \"don't move this\" category related to Cranelift compilation and it's something we've never really focused on. I don't mean to claim \"if we remove this <code>Vec</code> we're retain our lightning-fast compilation\" but moreso \"if we can I think it'd be good to avoid taking this debt on\". For example in the old iteration it looked like whenever a <code>Callee</code> is made it would clone the <code>descriptor</code> field of stack slots. That naively seems like it would clone per-call within a function. Now I have no idea how big the metadata is and it's always solvable by also slapping a few <code>Arc</code>s around.</p>\n<p>Basically efficiency isn't a huge point for me, it's just something I noticed. The higher-level point to me is that it feels like a wart in Cranelift's design where everywhere else embedder-related things are integers but here it happens to be a <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> because that happens to be what we want for this exact use case in Wasmtime</p>\n</blockquote>",

I agree that's a bad end-goal; I chose <code>Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> for the stack-slot descriptor specifically because it was an opaque representation.</li>\n<li>I do think this case is a bit different. Your mention of the <code>UserExternalName</code> example is illustrative: CLIF itself contains a list of all external names referenced; this list is legible to and kept updated by the inliner. That's a good example of \"IR contains all relevant info\", and we're assured that we'll get it right. In contrast, here, externalizing the information about the frame slot causes some really subtle and surprising possible footguns. To dig into your sketch a bit:</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For this problem specifically, I could very well be missing details, but I was under the impression that the idea was to tack a 64-bit integer/value/etc onto a Descriptor.

Note that the metadata (the stackslot format) is an artifact of the compilation of the original function; it's not computed separately or just part of the source or whatnot. So we need a merge step. The simple answer here is to let each function emit only its own original source-level-function metadata as it's appended to the text section.</p>\n<p>But there are at least two problems with this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>What happens if we do function-level DCE? (We can't; or we need a special \"we still need your metadata as a donation to the cause, but you don't get to go in .text\" mode.)</li>\n<li>We actually need another pre-pass to create the mapping from FuncKeys to frame-table descriptor indices. (In today's setup all descriptors are local to the function so we just lazily create them as needed during translation of progpoints.)<ul>\n<li>And this refactors the whole trait setup in <code>Compiler</code> -- right now it's explicitly one pass with an \"append to text section\" method.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is part of what I mean by new complexity -- the need to keep things in sync, and rely on the invariant that someone else will later emit that metadata, and the need to compute the mapping that the layer of indirection introduces, makes me a bit squeamish. In contrast, IR that is fully self-describing gives us solutions to all of the above for free.</p>\n</blockquote>",

That being said I still feel like it's an unresolved point to me. It's not the end of the world to paper over and just see how it works out, so I don't feel the need to block anything. That being said I'll still put my thoughts down:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>... chose Vec&lt;u8&gt; for the stack-slot descriptor specifically because it was an opaque representation.</p>\n<p>... Your mention of the UserExternalName example is illustrative: ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Personally I don't know how to grapple with these two things. On one hand it's ok for external symbols to be two 32-bit integers when they're more naturally represented in many other places as strings. This then works well enough during inlining that there's no reason to change this. For stack slots, though, you're saying it makes more sense to use a bag-of-bytes descriptor despite symbols, for example, intentionally (I assume?) not using that. I also don't understand why a bag-of-bytes or integer-on-stack-slot is any different w.r.t. inlining, both strategies simply copy whatever's there to somewhere else. The only difference is the interpretation later on and then it's either the bytes are there or a lookup table is needed.</p>\n<p>Now I agree that looking up the metadata by key is slightly more tricky. I don't understand why it's so tricky it's not worth pursuing, though. The merge step already exists in the form of <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/7cebfa206fe4a40ab54e9862f30b05c5fefb9043/crates/environ/src/compile/mod.rs#L301-L333\">linking everything together</a> and we already have to have mapping logic related to handling relocations. This is certainly a tricky step, but I don't understand why building a map at the beginning would make it any more meaningfully trickier.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is part of what I mean by new complexity -- the need to keep things in sync, and rely on the invariant that someone else will later emit that metadata, and the need to compute the mapping that the layer of indirection introduces, </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't fully grasp the increase in complexity here. My assumption is that a descriptor for a stack slot is more-or-less a function of a <code>FuncKey</code>. Given that there's not really anything to keep in sync other than something needs to produce a map of <code>FuncKey</code> to descriptor and each function compilation would produce its descriptor as part of the <code>CompiledFunction</code>. While DCE seems like something to keep in mind that doesn't seem like an insurmountable amount of complexity (e.g. the function is passed in with a flag saying \"don't put this in the text section\").</p>\n<p>Overall I agree it's different than what's already here today, but I again don't fully understand the rationale about the drastic increase in complexity.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>In contrast, IR that is fully self-describing gives us solutions to all of the above for free. </p>\n<p>...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>For example in the old iteration it looked like whenever a Callee is made it would clone the descriptor field of stack slots. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don't think that's true ...</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I meant <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/d2d8bb4b36e1f17e83c22a656b3dbca62ebf0d08/cranelift/codegen/src/machinst/abi.rs#L1256\">this line</a> from the previous version of this PR.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Apologies for the pushback -- it's a subjective design thing and I'm still not super-happy with the coupling, versus fully self-describing IR, but at least this is <em>possible</em>. It did require some small changes to the signatures in the compiler traits and you can see the extra pass over functions but at least it's enabled only when the tunable is set.</p>\n<p>(I think that by redesigning the serialization format a bit to separate out the slot-offset-from-FP from the offset-within-slot, I can share descriptors between inlined copies of functions rather than emitting them separately for each function that uses them; I'll poke at that on the Wasmtime side.)</p>\n</blockquote>",
