The previous approach was lossy because it only performed the sync when reserving stack space. While this approach worked in some cases, it failed to account for situations where the shadow stack pointer might be adjusted and aligned for calls. As a result, the stack pointer could become unaligned when claiming stack space, leading to issues at call sites.</p>\n<p>It is possible to avoid the unconditional move and perform it only when alignment is needed, i.e., at call sites and when the real stack pointer is unaligned. However, as of now, the simplest solution is to always perform the sync, which integrates best with the current infrastructure.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
