Consequently, I've folded that state into <code>ComponentInstance::instance_handle_tables</code>, renaming it to <code>instance_states</code>.  That involved a fair amount of code churn, but doesn't change behavior except as described in the second bullet point above.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Alex for the test case!</p>\n<p>Fixes #12098</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

For example given how frequently this tuple is created, passed around, and accessed I think it would make more sense to put it in a <code>struct</code> with named fields. It might be worth hanging methods off that as well? </p>\n<p>Overall the <code>concurrent.rs</code> file feels a bit disorganized as over time methods have moved around to various different <code>&amp;self</code> receivers based on the needs at the time, but I feel like it's pretty difficult to understand the various layers of abstractions there. To that extent I feel like this is moving the needle more towards the complicated side of things due to making the definition of \"what's an instance\" a bit murkier as there's sort of two definitions now instead of one.</p>\n<p>I don't really have a concrete suggestion though  unfortunate. \"Just\" replacing the tuple with a <code>struct</code> won't really do anything or move the needle on things, it just inches towards a local optima a bit more. I feel like this file is becoming more and more in need of a restructuring, refactoring, or something like that to make it more clear what methods go where, how context is passed around, and making various abstractions more first class.</p>\n<p>Do you have any ideas about how to improve the structure internally and/or disagree about how I feel about the organization though?</p>\n</blockquote>",

Personally, I'd be fine with just making them all freestanding functions and ditching any semblance of object-orientation (except for trait impls, of course), but that's the FP part of my brain talking, and I don't think it would be idiomatic with respect to the rest of the codebase.</li>\n<li>I've been pretty careful to ensure that each function takes only the parameters it needs, with the most specific types possible.  Later, when a given function ends up needing more or less than it used to, that often means moving the function elsewhere because <code>self</code> is now either too narrow or too broad.</li>\n<li>Having gone through several iterations of the above, everything feels pretty haphazard</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I don't have any brilliant ideas to address that, but one thing we could do is establish some guidelines about where to put a given method, e.g.:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every function that takes both a <code>&amp;mut StoreOpaque</code> and an <code>Instance</code> should be a method of <code>StoreOpaque</code> (and _not_ of <code>Instance</code>)</li>\n<li>Every function that takes a <code>&amp;mut ConcurrentState</code> should be a method of <code>ConcurrentState</code></li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm just making up the above, and don't care too much what the guidelines are, but having any guidelines at all could help.</p>\n</blockquote>",

For example <code>thing: Instance</code> may want to entirely go away in favor of <code>thing: InstanceAndRuntimeComponentInstanceIndex</code>. Except maybe as stored in structures in-memory, there it should retain the minimal size necessary. But things like that where with the benefit of hindsight we've got a better sense now of what pieces of state/options need to be plumbed around to various locations so we can consolidate. </p>\n<p>Overall I think it's worth having a convention for passing state around, even when not all of the state is used in every function. If it's just function arguments that's not really costly and the only time we need to think a bit harder is when it's in runtime data structures.</p>\n<p>Well, put another way, the way I'd phrase it is that I think we should use our experience of developing this module over the past year or so to refactor/clean it up. I don't think we need to go so far as documenting conventions, but more consistently using one <code>impl</code> vs another, passing state, smaller files, etc, I think will all help a lot.</p>\n</blockquote>",
