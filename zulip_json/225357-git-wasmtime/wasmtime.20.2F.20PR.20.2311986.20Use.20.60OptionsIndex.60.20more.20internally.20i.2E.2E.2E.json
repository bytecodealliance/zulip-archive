The <code>Options</code> type is a heavyweight package of all possible options which is effectively a duplication of what <code>OptionsIndex</code> points to, so that's removed in favor of directly accessing options.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
