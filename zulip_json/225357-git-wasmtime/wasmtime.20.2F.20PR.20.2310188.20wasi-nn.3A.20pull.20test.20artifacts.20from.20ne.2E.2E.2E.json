This broke Wasmtime's CI and was fixed in #9380 by pinning to a commit version. This change adopts the [download.01.org] site in Wasmtime's CI to fully cut the dependency to GitHub's LFS bandwidth limits.</p>\n<p>[openvino-rs]: <a href=\"https://github.com/intel/openvino-rs\">https://github.com/intel/openvino-rs</a><br>\n[download.01.org]: <a href=\"https://download.01.org/openvinotoolkit/fixtures\">https://download.01.org/openvinotoolkit/fixtures</a></p>\n<p>prtest:full</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
