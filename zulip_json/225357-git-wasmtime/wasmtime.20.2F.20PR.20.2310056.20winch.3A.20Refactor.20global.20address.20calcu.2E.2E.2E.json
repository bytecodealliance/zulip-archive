See the test case for details.</p>\n<p>Prior to this commit, imported global addresses were calculated with register offset addressing, using the scratch register as the base. With imported globals, the caller must load the address into an allocatable register which implies that in presence of spills the scratch register would get clobbered, affecting the previously loaded imported global address.</p>\n<p>This commit fixes the issue by returning an allocatable register, along with the offset and global type, which is expected to be freed by the caller after emitting the global load or store.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
