If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n<p>This PR fixed the bug in <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/examples/threads.c\"><code>examples/threads.c</code></a>, and removed the cargo build command for all examples/*.c files in the same manner as <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11132\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/pull/11132</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/examples/threads.wat\"><code>examples/threads.wat</code></a> imports the <code>hello</code> function with no arguments, but in threads.c the imported function was defined to take one argument (i32 type). That occurred the error <code>&gt; Error instantiating module!\\n</code>, so I fixed the signature and updated it to output the thread ID.</p>\n</blockquote>",
