Instead of having a <code>cfg</code> feature for just type validation, but always including the general record-replay code in the build, I think we should have a <code>#[cfg(feature = \"rr\")]</code> cargo feature for controlling whether we are building in the ability to do any kind of record-replay at all. (We don't want to force the smallest embedded builds of Wasmtime to include record-replay infrastructure, for example.) And then, when record-replay support was included at compile time, we can have runtime boolean knobs for whether to do type validation and divergence-checking when replaying. </p>\n<p>Finally, in order to make it so that the whole core runtime isn't littered with <code>#[cfg(feature = \"rr\")]</code>, we can do something similar to what we do with <code>#[cfg(feature = \"gc\")]</code> and the <code>wasmtime::runtime::gc</code> submodule:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"c1\">// crates/wasmtime/src/runtime/rr.rs</span>\n\n<span class=\"cp\">#[cfg(feature = </span><span class=\"s\">\"rr\"</span><span class=\"cp\">)]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">mod</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nn\">enabled</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">#[cfg(feature = </span><span class=\"s\">\"rr\"</span><span class=\"cp\">)]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">pub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">use</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">enabled</span><span class=\"p\">::</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"cp\">#[cfg(not(feature = </span><span class=\"s\">\"rr\"</span><span class=\"cp\">))]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">mod</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"nn\">disabled</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n<span class=\"cp\">#[cfg(not(feature = </span><span class=\"s\">\"rr\"</span><span class=\"cp\">))]</span>\n<span class=\"k\">pub</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">use</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">disabled</span><span class=\"p\">::</span><span class=\"o\">*</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>The <code>wasmtime::runtime::rr::enabled</code> submodule would have the actual record-replay implementation, and the <code>wasmtime::runtime::rr::disabled</code> submodule would have a stubbed out version of the same public API but without constructors and with every public type being a newtype of <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/0f457fad63258ef3354008eb2da188cae0a63686/crates/wasmtime/src/runtime/uninhabited.rs#L5\"><code>wasmtime::runtime::uninhabited::Uninhabited</code></a>. This pattern lets the core runtime usage of record-replay APIs look the same regardless whether we actually build in the code to do record-replay.</p>\n<p>The other thing I think we need before this can land is some kind of testing or fuzzing story. At minimum, we should (1) <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/815c10dea9cc130316ac9b58c4aaed3e97eb8760/crates/fuzzing/src/generators/config.rs#L541-L580\">make it so that the fuzzer can turn on recording during our existing fuzzing</a>, and (2) we should have a smoke test that records some kind of Wasm program and then replays it back again and asserts that we get the same result again. As a follow up, I think we should also generalize that smoke test into a new fuzz target where we take an arbitrary Wasm module generated by the fuzzer, record its execution, and then replay that execution and assert that we get the same results (we can mostly rely on enabling the internal type validation and divergence checks for these assertions).</p>\n<p>Let me know if any of this isn't clear or if I've overlooked something.</p>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</blockquote>",
