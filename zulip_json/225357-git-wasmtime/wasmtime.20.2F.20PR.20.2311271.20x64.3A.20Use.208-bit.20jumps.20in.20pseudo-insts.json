In lieu of this Cranelift pessimistically emits 32-bit jumps on x64, for example, for all jumps between basic blocks. This is a difficult problem to solve in general but for pseudo-instructions it's a much more targeted problem which should be easier to solve.</p>\n<p>This commit updates all pseudo-instructions in the x64 backend to use 8-bit jumps instead of full 32-bit jumps within their code bodies. It's statically known that the instructions bodies being generate are all small enough to fit in 8 bits. This helps shrink the generated code for a number of instructions whenever a pseudo-inst is used instead of basic blocks.</p>\n<p>Optimizing jumps between basic blocks is left as a future optimization as it's likely to be much more difficult to implement than this.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
