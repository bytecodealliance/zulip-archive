Much of this will come back, but in a very different form, for component model support as component-init is merged into this repository. For now though to prepare for this refactoring this commit removes all this historical support to keep core module wizening focused on just core modules.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
