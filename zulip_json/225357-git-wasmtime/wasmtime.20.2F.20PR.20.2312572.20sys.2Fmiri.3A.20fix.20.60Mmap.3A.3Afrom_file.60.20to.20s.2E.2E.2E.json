It turns out that this matters when we try to <code>Mmap::from_file</code> more than once, e.g. when enabling guest debugging and thus mapping private copies of code.</p>\n<p>No test yet as this will be covered by upcoming miri coverage of guest debugging.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
