For example, this operation could be in a block that is dominated by a control-flow bounds check that makes this operation safe, and that invariant is not reflected in its operands. It would be unsafe to code motion such an instruction above its associated bounds check, even if its data dependencies would still be satisfied.</p>\n<p>I've added this flag because we were doing exactly that kind of code motion where we moved a <code>readonly</code> and <code>notrap</code> memory operation past its associated null-check and therefore it was no longer safe to perform and we would get a segfault. This could only be triggered when the Wasm typed-function-references proposal was enabled, which is not a tier-1 proposal, so it is not considered a vulnerability. Nonetheless, it is a pretty scary kind of bug, and other code paths weren't affected due to pretty subtle interactions. And this is the motivation for the new \"pure\" flag: without needing to explicitly opt into data-dependency-based code motion (i.e. set the \"pure\" flag), it is too easy to accidentally move loads past their control-flow-based safety guards.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
