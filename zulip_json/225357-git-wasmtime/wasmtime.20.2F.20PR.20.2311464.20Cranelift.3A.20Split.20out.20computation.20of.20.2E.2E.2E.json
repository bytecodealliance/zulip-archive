Otherwise, they would have to do something like</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">cursor</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">next_block</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n<span class=\"kd\">let</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">next_pos</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">cursor</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">current_position</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n<span class=\"n\">cursor</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">prev_block</span><span class=\"p\">();</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>These new methods aren't used anywhere yet, other than the implementation of the cursor-position-updating methods they were split out from, but it seems useful to expose. I almost needed it for some inlining stuff, but ultimately took a slightly different approach.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
