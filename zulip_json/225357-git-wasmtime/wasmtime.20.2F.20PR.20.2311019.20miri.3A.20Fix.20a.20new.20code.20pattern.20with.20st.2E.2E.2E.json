At the end of the day I'm honestly not 100% sure what this doing or how to explain all the behavior we were seeing, but this seems to be basically equivalent and we're otherwise able to get a bit further so I figured I'd commit this.</p>\n<p>Along the way I updated the preexisting <code>table-intrinsics</code> test to correctly use the table it was supposed to be using instead of using the previous table by accident.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
