The first didn't touch anything in <code>wasmtime-cli</code> and the second does touch quite a bit that could affect it so it's currently an assumption of mine that the s390x-failure there was specific to s390x.</p>\n<p>I tried running the test suite in a loop locally for a bit using s390x/qemu and so far it hasn't failed in the same way. I figured I'd open an issue to keep track of things if they happen in the future.</p>\n<p>cc @uweigand </p>\n</blockquote>",
