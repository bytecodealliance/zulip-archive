Because these last two files were generated in the assembler's <code>OUT_DIR</code>, they caused issues for deterministic builds that expect those files in <code>cranelift-codegen</code>'s <code>OUT_DIR</code> (see #10348). This change fixes that by moving all of the assembler's generated integration code, the ISLE instruction definitions and their accompanying Rust macro, to the <code>cranelift-codegen-meta</code> crate.</p>\n<p>This has the added advantage that <code>cranelift-assembler-x64</code> now can focus exclusively on being an assembler and not being concerned with the ISLE integration, which is substantial.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
