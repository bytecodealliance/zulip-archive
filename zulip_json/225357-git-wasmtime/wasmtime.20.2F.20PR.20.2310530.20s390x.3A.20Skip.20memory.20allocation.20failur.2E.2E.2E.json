This is not the case on s390x, where the full 64-bit address space is available for allocation. (Of course, actually using that much memory would still fail at some point, but the mere allocation may not, depending on the kernel's memory overcommit handling configuration.)</p>\n<p>Note that running the tests under qemu will cause the expected failure, which is why this problem is not noticed by the CI.</p>\n<p>Simply disable these test on s390x.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
