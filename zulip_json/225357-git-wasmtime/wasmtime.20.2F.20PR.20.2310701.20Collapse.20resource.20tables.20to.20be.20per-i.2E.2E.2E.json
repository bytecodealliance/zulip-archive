The upstream specification changed in <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/component-model/issues/427\">WebAssembly/component-model#427</a> and while it's been awhile since that change this is Wasmtime catching up to that change. It's expected that these paths are going to get stressed more with component model async and more kinds of handles so this additionally refactors things to leave sort of \"holes\" where async resources are going to go.</p>\n<p>This notably will result in different behavior for guest programs. Previously if there were two resources imported into a guest they could have overlapping indices and now they're going to all have disjoint indices since they're all in the same index space. It's expected that this is will have a minimal, if any, impact on component guests as in theory they're all mostly treating handles as opaque indexes today anyway.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

For example the original issue was importing two versions of <code>wasi:io/poll</code> and accidentally crossing handle indexes between the two. This PR doesn't go so far to attach debugging names to resources so it's known how to inform the users/components what exactly a mismatch was, it only says \"expected resource found different resource\" effectively. I've left the improvement of error messages to a future PR.</p>\n</blockquote>",
