These platforms do allow toggling between the two with a syscall (SELinux) or a cpu instruction (arm64 macOS, stably exposed as a libc function call), but this is much slower than a plain write. Enforcing W^X is genuinely useful. Back when an executable stack was common for example as soon as you had a stack buffer overflow, getting arbitrary code execution with shell code was trivial. Nowadays because of W^X you have to do much more effort for something like ROP.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Cranelift does work well in JIT contexts; Wasmtime uses it this way to great effect.</p>\n<p>Patchpoints are distinct from JIT: one can JIT in a way that publishes code once and does not modify it later. Patchpoints are useful mostly for avoiding any dynamic cost of branches when a branch changes very rarely -- e.g., turning on debugging mode and adding breakpoint-check logic, or adding a new type-specialized behavior.</p>\n<p>The point made above about performance implications still holds -- publishing code (turning it from writable to executable) is <em>very</em> expensive on some platforms, e.g. aarch64 requires a syscall and an IPI to all cores to do an icache synchronization barrier (and possibly a full icache flush on cheaper microarchitectures). Even modern x86 does W^X (as bjorn3 says above) and that implies a TLB shootdown across all cores. That said, all those are system design concerns, and Cranelift as a compiler library probably isn't the place to issue an edict and ban this technique for those reasons.</p>\n<p>My main consideration for a design of this feature would be the IR semantics -- it's not clear what it would look like, other than a giant \"insert code here\" hole; then one would have to carefully specify what the ABI is / how that code interacts with the rest of code that Cranelift generates. That's a hard thing to do in general, rather than designing in concert with a specific VM.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This doesn't require any changes to Cranelift and avoids needing to do the trickiest bits in the generated code directly, where things are generally just harder than in plain Rust (or whatever) code.</p>\n<p>This is what I would do, rather than patch the Cranelift's generated code at runtime. Patching code is tricky in multi-threaded scenarios and involves icache flushing and such that makes it a more expensive operation than it might first seem.</p>\n</blockquote>",
