However, my custom logic only uses a small portion of OpenSSL, yet the resulting .wasm file is significantly larger than necessary due to the full inclusion of the OpenSSL dependency.</p>\n<p>I experimented with different pre-compiled Wasm versions of OpenSSL from GitHub, and observed the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Larger Wasm file sizes result in slower execution times, even though the actual function being called is the same.</li>\n<li>This performance degradation affects certain parts of the Wasm function execution more significantly. Specifically, function calls into OpenSSL exhibit significantly increased latency as the .wasm file size grows.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To reduce file size and improve performance, I also tried compiling my project to a regular Wasm module (instead of a component), and ran <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen\">wasm-opt</a> to optimize it. This reduced the file size and improved execution speed as expected.</p>\n<p>However, wasm-opt currently does not support Wasm components.</p>\n<p>So my questions are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Why does increasing the size of the Wasm component (even if unrelated to the actual execution path) cause slower runtime performance, especially for specific function calls into OpenSSL?</li>\n<li>Are there any tools or workflows available to optimize or shrink Wasm components, similar to what wasm-opt does for modules?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n</blockquote>",
