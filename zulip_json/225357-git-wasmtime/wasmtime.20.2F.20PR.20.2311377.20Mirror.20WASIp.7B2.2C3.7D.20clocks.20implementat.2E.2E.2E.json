The goal here is to have the impls be implemented and look roughly the same across WASIp2 and WASIp3, namely the target of the implementation of now <code>WasiClocksCtxView</code> instead of <code>WasiCtxView</code>. This makes the trait implementations a bit more flexible as it means embedders aren't required to, for example, provide a full WASI context for clocks but just clock-related context.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
