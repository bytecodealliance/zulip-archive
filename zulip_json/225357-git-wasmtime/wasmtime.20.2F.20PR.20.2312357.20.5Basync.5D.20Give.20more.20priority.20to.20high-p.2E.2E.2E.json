This means that, if there are multiple low-priority tasks and an early one adds a task to the high-priority queue, this new task has to wait for the remaining low-priority tasks to complete before it gets a chance to run.</p>\n<p>This PR changes the event loop to run at most one low-priority task on every iteration. As such, if this task enqueues a high-priority task, that task will get a chance to run before any other low-priority tasks.</p>\n<p>I also reduced the nesting of the <code>poll_until</code> loop and added better names to make the code more easily understandable. </p>\n</blockquote>",
