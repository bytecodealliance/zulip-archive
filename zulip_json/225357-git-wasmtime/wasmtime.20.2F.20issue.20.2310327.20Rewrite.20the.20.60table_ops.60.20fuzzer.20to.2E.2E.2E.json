We don't need to do exactly these milestones in exactly this order. It is okay if, in the process of implementing them, we find reason to do milestone X before Y and decide to swap their order. It is okay if one milestone becomes three PRs, or two milestones become one PR. This is just a sketch to provide some light structure.

This should become a <code>ref.cast</code> instruction in the Wasm binary.</li>\n<li>\n<p>Add a fuzzer op for fallible downcasts. This should not trap and kill the whole program if the downcast fails. In the fullness of time, we will want to generate blocks that do things with the downcasted value that are only executed if the downcast succeeds, something like this:</p>\n<p>```<br>\nblock (param ...)<br>\n  ;; Break out of this block if we fail to cast the reference on top of the<br>\n  ;; stack to its subtype.<br>\n  ref.br_on_cast_fail ...</p>\n<p>;; Do stuff with the subtype reference...<br>\nend</p>\n<p>;; Control joins again here and the program continues.<br>\n```</p>\n<p>And we will want to exercise both the <code>br_on_cast_fail</code> and <code>br_on_cast</code> instructions, which will require slightly different shapes of blocks.</p>\n<p>Initially, we can simply downcast to a nullable subtype reference, where we get null if the downcast fails:</p>\n<p><code>\nblock (param (ref null $my_super)) (result (ref null $my_sub))\n  local.tee $my_temp\n  ;; Test if the downcast will succeed.\n  ref.test ...\n  if (result (ref null $my_sub))\n    ;; The downcast will succeed, do a downcast-or-trap operation which we\n    ;; know will not trap.\n    local.get $my_temp\n    ref.cast ...\n  else\n    ;; The downcast would fail, so just create a null reference instead.\n    ref.null ...\n  end\nend\n</code></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Goal: Exercise subtyping checks and casting logic.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;/details&gt;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] Add support for POD and <code>externref</code> fields in <code>struct</code>s<br>\n  &lt;details&gt;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add generation and mutation support for <code>i8</code>/<code>i16</code>/<code>i32</code>/<code>i64</code>/<code>f32</code>/<code>f64</code>/<code>v128</code>/<code>externref</code> struct fields. Reference fields will be trickier and can be added in another milestone.</li>\n<li>Add fuzzer ops for <code>struct.get</code> and <code>struct.set</code></li>\n<li>Maybe: Add fuzzer ops for creating POD constants? Or should we just create zero constants on demand when necessary in the AST-to-Wasm-binary generation step? We aren't trying to exercise arithmetic in this fuzzer, that is well exercised by other fuzzers already, so the only interesting case for POD data is really when it comes from another <code>struct</code>'s field. Other than that interesting case, we just need a <em>some</em> value in order to allocate a struct containing these values.</li>\n<li>Add mutators to add, remove, and modify a field in a defined <code>struct</code> type</li>\n<li>Goal: start exercising accessing, reading from, and writing to GC objects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;/details&gt;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>[ ] Add support for concretely-typed references as <code>struct</code> fields<br>\n  &lt;details&gt;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Extend the items from the previous milestone to full type references between different defined <code>struct</code> types</li>\n<li>Also add support for abstract <code>structref</code> types</li>\n<li>Non-nullable type references will be tricky: if we have a cycle of non-nullable references, then those types are not currently inhabitable.<ul>\n<li>Can detect and correct this in our fix-up pass, perhaps</li>\n<li>Okay to punt on this in a first PR, but we definitely would want to start handling them in a closely following PR.
