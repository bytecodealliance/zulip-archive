The <code>br</code> instruction requires an address register operand (i.e. GPR 1-15, but not GPR 0).  In the failing case, the compiler chose to use GPR 0 to hold <code>pc</code>.  To fix this, you'll need to use the <code>reg_addr</code> register class instead of <code>reg</code> for <code>pc</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>",
