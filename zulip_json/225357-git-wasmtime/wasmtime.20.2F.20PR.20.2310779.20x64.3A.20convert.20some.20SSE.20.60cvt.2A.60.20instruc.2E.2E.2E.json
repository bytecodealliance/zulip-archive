These also have their truncating versions, </code>cvtt*`. This change defines all of the instructions Cranelift needs (there are a few more) and wires them up in ISLE and in various emitted sequences. For these sequences, this chooses to factor out the choice of instruction into a closure since we no longer can pass around an opcode.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
