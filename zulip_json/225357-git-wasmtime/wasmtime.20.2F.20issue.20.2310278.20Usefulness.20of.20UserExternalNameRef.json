For pragmatic reasons, the Wasmtime embedding of Cranelift makes a direct mapping of <code>UserExternalName</code> to Wasm function indices. One of the goals of the incremental compilation design was to allow for some \"index slippage\" as a Wasm module is changed during development and still be able to reuse most of the compilations. We make this work by adding the level of indirection: so for example, if Wasm function 1000 calls functions 1001 and 1002, and later the user adds a function and rebuilds the module so we have function 1001 calling 1002 and 1003 (but the bodies are all the same otherwise), we would have different <code>UserExternalName</code>s but by referring to <code>UserExternalNameRef</code> indices 0 and 1 instead (and substituting 0-&gt;1001, 1-&gt;1002 or 0-&gt;1002, 1-&gt;1003 in the cached compilation result) we can reuse the same compilation.</p>\n<p>Because of this, we can't remove <code>UserExternalNameRef</code>. Hopefully that clears things up!</p>\n</blockquote>",
