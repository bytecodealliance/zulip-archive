There is a bunch we can do here, but this commit just lays down the initial infrastructure and plumbs the type info through to the <code>ref.is_null</code> implementation. We will now avoid actually performing null check when the input to a <code>ref.is_null</code> instruction is a non-nullable ref type.</p>\n<p>Note that this depends on both an eventual <code>wasm-tools</code> version bump and that we fix a bug in the arity stuff in <code>wasmparser</code>, which I have not tracked down yet. (One of the <code>disas</code> tests currently panics because we fail to provide an arity for a valid, reachable <code>end</code> instruction.)</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

In that if it's invalid the arity may be <code>None</code>. Once we get past <code>validator.op</code>, though, then it's known that <code>operand_types</code> is valid. Although we also can't move this block because <code>validator.op</code> mutates the validator.</p>\n<p>Also, can this <code>.unwrap()</code> after the validator to ensure that the signatures of the before/after/translate all take a slice, not an optional slice?</p>\n</blockquote>",
