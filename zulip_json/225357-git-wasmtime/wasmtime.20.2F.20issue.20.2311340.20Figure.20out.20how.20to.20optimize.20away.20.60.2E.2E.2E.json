I guess we also need to check the flags, but we shouldn't need to write to them at all.</p>\n<p>Addressing this likely involves implementing <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/4167\">dead-store-elimination</a> in our alias analysis, but maybe also requires some higher-level analyses and logic in the adapter generation code as well, where we know exactly what can and cannot observe those globals and when.</p>\n</blockquote>",

This would work well here, allowing us to give these flags unique regions (well in a world where we go crazy with regions, we might need to map multiple application-level logical regions onto the same cranelift-level \"physical\" regions due to bitpacking constraints and running out of <code>u8</code> space, or else we would have to make a new alias region entity table; that is all something we can deal with if/when we get to it).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The tricky part is the condition that no intervening may-trap operations occur.

Guest Wasm cannot access them directly.</p>\n<p>However, they do prevent re-entrancy (that is what these gets/sets are implementing in the first place) and the traps we raise when we detect re-entrancy are visible to embedders (the guest component halts and cannot be re-entered after one of these traps, as attempts to do so will just keep hitting this re-entrancy trap).</p>\n<p>They are not exported, and so embedders cannot get a <code>wasmtime::Global</code> to introspect them. I think they will show up in core dumps, but that would just be us leaking an implementation detail in our core dumps, essentially, and I would argue that doesn't \"count\". Definitely shouldn't be any way for the embedder to modify these flags directly.</p>\n</blockquote>",

We could also consider whether other semantic properties make sense, e.g. noting a region is readonly, or guaranteed not to be altered by callees, etc. Perhaps it even makes sense to move all semantic info we carry on <code>MemFlags</code> into the region? (I'm struggling to think of a case where we could have loads/stores with different semantics at different points to the same disjoint subset of addresses...)</p>\n<p>If I recall correctly, one of the concerns we had at that time was whether we could fit a whole region identifier in the 16-byte <code>InstructionData</code> for a load/store, hence the <code>u8</code> region ID; stores <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/cf88a7c6010e845b50e3332aea8a146d4d8a3bb4/cranelift/codegen/meta/src/shared/instructions.rs#L795-L798\">already have</a> opcode, 32-bit offset, address, data, and flags (so three <code>u32</code>s and discriminant+flags packed in a fourth). Limiting to 256 regions seems anemic (consider: calling many different components from one large init function, each with their own reentrancy flag). But if we're replacing <code>MemFlags</code> (per above) by moving its flags to the region, then we have 16 or 24 bits (depending on <code>InstructionData</code> discriminant size) to play with, which seems reasonable.</p>\n</blockquote>",
