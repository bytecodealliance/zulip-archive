It also generates metadata to record the precise reason for the trap and stores that in <code>fact::trampoline::Compiler::traps</code>.  However, that metadata isn't used anywhere, so at runtime the user always sees the generic \"wasm \\`unreachable\\` instruction executed\" message; the precise reason is no longer available.  Consequently, we've had to temporarily fork a few spec tests which expect precise trap messages, replacing them with generic ones.</p>\n</blockquote>",
