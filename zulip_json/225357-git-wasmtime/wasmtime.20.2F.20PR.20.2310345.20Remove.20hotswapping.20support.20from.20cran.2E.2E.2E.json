Better hotswapping support will likely require a fundamentally different implementation.</p>\n<p>Also fix a bug that prevents cg_clif from switching to is_pic=false for the jit mode.</p>\n<p>cc <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/2735\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/issues/2735</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
