This instruction was not previously supported by Cranelift so I opted to add support via the new <code>cranelift-assembler-x64</code> crate instead of trying to fit it into the existing <code>emit.rs</code>/<code>MInst</code> infrastructure. This was a good learning experience for myself and was also fun to do!</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

In talking with Andrew I temporarily came up with the \"solution\" in this PR but our conclusion was that #10232 was the better way to go in terms of robustly supporting this encoding pattern in x64 instructions.</p>\n</blockquote>",
