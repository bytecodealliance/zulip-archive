This is only true if the <code>std</code> feature is also active. When <code>std</code> is disabled the <code>custom</code> implementation of OS primitives is used instead meaning that it shouldn't be automatically assumed signals/virtual memory are available.</p>\n<p>Resolves a build issue found [on Zulip].</p>\n<p>[on Zulip]: <a href=\"#narrow/channel/217126-wasmtime/topic/.E2.9C.94.20pulley32.20on.20x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\">https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/channel/217126-wasmtime/topic/.E2.9C.94.20pulley32.20on.20x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
