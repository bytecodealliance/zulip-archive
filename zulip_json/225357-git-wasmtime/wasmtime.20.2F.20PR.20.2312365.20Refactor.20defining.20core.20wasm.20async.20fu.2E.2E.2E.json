This consolidates everything into <code>HostFunc</code> which duplicates type signatures a bit more but complexity-wise reduces the amount of internal duplication.</p>\n<p>This additionally notably cuts down on usage of <code>block_on</code> literally, if not conceptually, which is going to eventually be important for rationalizing it with <code>*_concurrent</code> functions.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
