The memory does not have a limit (the <code>25</code> is its initial size in Wasm pages), so it will grow up to 4GiB, or about 32K recursions (4Gi / 128 Ki, minus initial 25 pages).</p>\n<p>It seems unsurprising to me that a program that recurses 32K times runs out of stack. Perhaps the other Wasm engines have different default stack sizes, or allocate a different (smaller) frame per function. Stack exhaustion is one of several sources of engine-specific nondeterminism in Wasm, so if you're running tests of engines against each other, you will need to account for that.</p>\n<p>Given all that, I think this is not a bug, just nondeterminism allowed by the spec. Do you agree? Or is there something I'm missing?</p>\n</blockquote>",

At best other runtimes have different defaults for when stack overflow occurs and at worst other runtimes are going against the spec as @primoly mentions. In either case resource exhaustion is not specified to be the exact same across all runtimes so I don't think there's anything for Wasmtime to do here, so closing.</p>\n<p>I would also echo what @cfallin said, avoiding the indirection of a zip is much appreciated.</p>\n</blockquote>",
