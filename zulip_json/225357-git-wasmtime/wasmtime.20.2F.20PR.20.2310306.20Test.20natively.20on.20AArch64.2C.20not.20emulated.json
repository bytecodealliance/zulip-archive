This should be a bit faster but primarily helps build confidence that it runs on real hardware.</p>\n<p>I'll note that release builds aren't updated at this time to run on native hardware since that's moreso about glibc compatibility and it's a bit easier to keep the setup we currently have for that. If <code>*-arm</code> machines are noticably faster than the default x64 machines then we could in theory move everything over to an aarch64-based machine as opposed to just the aarch64 build.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
