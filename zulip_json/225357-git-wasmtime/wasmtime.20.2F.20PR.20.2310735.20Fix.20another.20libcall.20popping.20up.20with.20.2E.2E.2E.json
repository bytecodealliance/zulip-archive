Fuzzing found this issue and to help verify this is the last one I've run the whole <code>*.wast</code> test suite with the x86_64 baseline (no target features) and saw the panic before this PR and no more panics after.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
