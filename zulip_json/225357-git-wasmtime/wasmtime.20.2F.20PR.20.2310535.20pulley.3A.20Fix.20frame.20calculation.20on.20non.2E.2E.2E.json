This matches what other backends such as riscv64 do as well. This is not exposed through wasm I believe because no native signature can exercise this code (I think) and all wasm code uses the <code>tail</code> ABI anyway.</p>\n<p>This was discovered by running Cranelift filetests using ASAN which is something I hope to be able to add to our CI in the near future.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
