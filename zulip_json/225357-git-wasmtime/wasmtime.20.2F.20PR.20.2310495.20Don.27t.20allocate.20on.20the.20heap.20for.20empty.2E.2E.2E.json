When calculating the maximum bit that might be set the implementation now subtracts one. This more accurately models the maximum bit that could be set and additionally guarantees the property that <code>with_capacity(0)</code> does not allocate anything on the heap.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
