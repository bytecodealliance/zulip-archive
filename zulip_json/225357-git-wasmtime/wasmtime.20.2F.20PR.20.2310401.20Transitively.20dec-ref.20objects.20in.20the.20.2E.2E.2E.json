This commit changes that, so that now we will decrement the reference counts of other objects referenced by an object that is being deallocated.</p>\n<p>This requires some method of tracing an object's outgoing edges. To avoid needing to keep around and dispatch upon type-specific information about which struct fields are GC references, for example, we instead pack all GC references at the start of the object, just after its header. We additionally keep a count of how many GC references an object has in its header. This allows us to create a slice of any object's GC references, and we can uniformly trace any GC object's outgoing edges. We don't need to reflect on the GC object's actual type.</p>\n<p>A final detail: the DRC collector was previously storing the object size in the common GC header's reserved bits. It now stores the number of GC refs there instead, and the object size is stored in its own field in the DRC-specific header, next to the ref count. This is nice because, since we are making the DRC header larger anyways, it raises the DRC collector's implementation limit on object size from <code>u27::MAX</code> to <code>u32::MAX</code>.</p>\n<p>Fixes #9701</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
