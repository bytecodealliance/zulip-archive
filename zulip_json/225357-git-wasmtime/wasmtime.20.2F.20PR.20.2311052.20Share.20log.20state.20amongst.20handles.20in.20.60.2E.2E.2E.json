This commit fixes the log streams of <code>wasmtime serve</code> to share state amongst the various handles created by putting internal state into an <code>Arc</code> and mutating it behind the scenes in the implementation.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
