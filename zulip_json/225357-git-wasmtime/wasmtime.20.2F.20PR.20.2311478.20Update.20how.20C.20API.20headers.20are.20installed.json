While I thought this inherited CMake configuration options turns out it doesn't so the installed headers don't actually reflect the configured features at build time. This commit changes this to install from the headers-in-the-build-directory which indeed do reflect features.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
