The cause was when <code>fd_readdir</code> returned after skipping all directory entries it forgot to write the final <code>*bufused = 0</code> out-param in the early-exit, unlike the end of the function which already sets this.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
