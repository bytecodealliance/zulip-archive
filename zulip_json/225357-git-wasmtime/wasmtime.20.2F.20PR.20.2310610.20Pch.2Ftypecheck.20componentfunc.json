Components import abstract resources which don't match any types defined in Rust, which is what would be passed in as the type parameters here. The type-check can only be done once you have an <code>InstancePre</code> or <code>Linker</code> where the actual resource types are all assigned and we can match up the host-provided resources with our expectations.</p>\n<p>That being said I do like the property that <code>FooIndices</code> is all you need to \"quickly load the thing\" and as such represents a type-checked version of the component. Given that one options is to switch this to using <code>InstancePre&lt;T&gt;</code> instead of <code>&amp;Component</code> as a construction argument. In doing so though we're not really prepared to have that working. The problem is that we'd have to prevent crossing <code>FooIndices</code> values by accident.  Right now export indices are intrinsically tied to a <code>Component</code> which has a unique ID, but not a <code>Linker</code> which does not have a unique ID. That means you could technically create a <code>FooIndices</code> with one linker and then extract exports from a component created with another linker, and if we skip the type-checks with <code>unsafe</code> (which I assume this PR is building towards) that could be memory-unsafe.</p>\n<p>That might be solvable though by putting a unique ID in linkers and plumbing that to <code>InstancePre</code> and <code>Instance</code> which is checked.</p>\n</blockquote>",

I got pretty tangled up with InstanceType because it borrows arcs of Store's type tables instead of cloning the arcs, so I am going to either change the structure or make a variant of it that owns the arcs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>",
