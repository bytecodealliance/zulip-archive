For example how was this source generate? Fuzz-generated? Minimized from C? Edge-case behavior of WASI varies runtime-to-runtime as the precise semantics of WASI have evolved over time. For WASIp1 there is no more development and much of its APIs are under-specified as the eventual work that would have gone into specifying them went into the component model instead.</p>\n<p>My guess is this is likely not a bug in Wasmtime but probably a difference in validation of parameters with other runtimes. For example other runtimes may generate a different error first and/or skip validation that should be required. Understanding the provenance of this program and what it's trying to do is going to be key in understanding what exactly is the desired output of this program. Minimized <code>*.wat</code> code generally isn't too helpful for WASI APIs, it's best to start from a source language if possible (e.g. there's nothing to debug with in the files you posted)</p>\n</blockquote>",
