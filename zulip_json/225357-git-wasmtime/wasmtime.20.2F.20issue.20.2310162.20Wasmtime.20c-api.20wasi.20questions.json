While certainly possible you're probably not going to get too too much support in doing so as WASIp1 is largely \"on the way out\" in favor of WASIp2. WASIp1 represents a snapshot in the development of WASI, and like all snapshots of points in time it's not perfect in the sense that it's not 100% documented with intros/tutorials/examples/etc. If you're going to implement WASIp1 from scratch you'll need to be doing a lot of research on your own for something like this.</p>\n<p>Wasmtime does not support non-standard and ad-hoc extensions to wasm like WAMR does. Wasmtime does not support creating defacto standards that \"just happen to work for now\" and proliferating them. While you are well within your right to build your own libc imports in your host so the guest doesn't have to have its own libc that something you'll be making as an embedder and not something we'll be building in.</p>\n</blockquote>",

What you're struggling with are really low level details of how wasm is implemented and WASI works today. Basically the purpose of WASIp2 and the component model are so you don't have to deal with questions like this (you're not alone, everyone is confused by this).</p>\n<p>The main thing to understand is that there's not really much magic involved here. For example strings are \"just\" a wasm pointer (plus maybe a length) and a wasm pointer is an offset from the base of linear memory. That means to interpret a wasm pointer you'll need to use, for example <code>wasmtime_memory_data</code> (after bounds-checks with <code>wasmtime_memory_data_size</code>). The wasm pointer is then offset from that in a contiguous chunk of bytes. I would very much caution about taking care doing this in C as this is where vulnerabilities and segfaults are very easy to write. If you do this all yourself you're going to be writing your own syscall layer effectively which is very error-prone and mistakes are often exploitable.</p>\n<p>The other thing is that there's no way to allocate memory in the guest from the host. That's just not something that's inherently part of wasm that Wasmtime could magically do for example. Instead what you'll need to do is have the module export a \"malloc\" function and then you call that to get a pointer.</p>\n<p>Again though I'll really caution quite a lot about all of this. This is a custom syscall layer which deals with really low-level details of how wasm&lt;-&gt;host communication works. This is very error-prone code and even on the best of days it's difficult to get right. At the same time though I'll definitely acknowledge as well though that WASIp2/components aren't supported in the C API at this time, and that part definitely isn't helping alas.</p>\n</blockquote>",
