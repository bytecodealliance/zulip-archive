I don't think we have a plan of how to expose all this in the C API at this time, but it'd likely be centered around <code>OwnedRooted&lt;T&gt;</code>  and more-or-less look like the Rust API. If that still leaves you with questions though we can try to help out with the design here.</p>\n</blockquote>",
