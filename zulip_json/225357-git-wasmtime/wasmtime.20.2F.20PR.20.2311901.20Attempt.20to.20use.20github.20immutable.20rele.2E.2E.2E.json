My failed attempt to enable this earlier turned out to, expectedly, not work. This commit is an attempt to make things work. Specifically releases are now created as a draft initially, then release assets are attached, and finally it's automatically marked as a non-draft. While one could make a reasonable argument that a human should be involved in making the release a non-draft there's also something nice about just hitting merge on a PR and letting the release ride through CI.</p>\n<p>[Immutable Releases]: <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/immutable-releases\">https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/immutable-releases</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed.
