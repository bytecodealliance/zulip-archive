Fix by zero-filling the object body in <code>alloc_raw</code> so trace_gc_ref skips uninitialized slots, then tracing and dec-refing children in <code>dealloc_uninit</code> before freeing.</p>\n<p>Fixes #12456</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

For example this pessimizes all allocations to be zero-filled instead of truly uninitialized. This isn't even used by compiled guest wasm and it's also only used on the host, a secondary vector for implementing GC things. </p>\n<p>Given all that, I'm wondering if we should step back a bit and reconsider the basic strategy here. For example I would naively expect that one way to do this would be to enhance the type-check we have for initializing structs/arrays/etc on the host such that the initialization step never fails. We already do a type-check there and it looks like the externref bits aren't fully checked there. One other way to tackle this problem would be to (1) enhance the type-check to avoid failing during initialization and (2) use <code>.unwrap()</code> to assert that per-field initialization succeeds.</p>\n<p>cc @fitzgen on this as well, you likely have thoughts too! I also think there's a case to be made for \"let's fix the bug first and then make it fast later\", in which case I think this PR is perfectly suitable. The only downside is that it puts things in a bit of a weird state where the \"uninit\" terminology is now more of a \"maybe uninit maybe not\" which is a bit confusing. Not enough to block landing this though, but that's what led me to reconsider the overall approach.</p>\n</blockquote>",
