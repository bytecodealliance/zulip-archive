This should be mildly more efficient, since we can avoid an unnecessary loop iteration and its <code>match</code> on the just-legalized instruction data and opcode.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
