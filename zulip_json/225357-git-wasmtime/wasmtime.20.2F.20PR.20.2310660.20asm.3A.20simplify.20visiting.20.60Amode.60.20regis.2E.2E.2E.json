This was because it was difficult to capture the type needed for constraining the <code>Amode</code> (i.e., <code>Registers::ReadGpr</code>). This change moves that functionality to a helper function with identical behavior, simplifying the generated code and API surface.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
