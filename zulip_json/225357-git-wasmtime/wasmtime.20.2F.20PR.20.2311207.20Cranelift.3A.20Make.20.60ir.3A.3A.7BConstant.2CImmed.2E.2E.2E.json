Therefore, they really are entities rather than immediates.</p>\n<p>This recategorization means that they will now be properly mapped in <code>ir::InstructionData::map</code> calls.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
