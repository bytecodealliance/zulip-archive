Specifically the encoding of a RIP-relative addressing mode required knowing the number of bytes at the end of an instruction but this was accidentally hardcoded to 0. In #10782 <code>imul</code> instructions were added where a RIP-relative address mode can be used in conjunction with an immediate which cause the RIP-relative addressing to load from the wrong address.</p>\n<p>This bug can in theory affect other instructions in the new assembler as well, but auditing the list of instructions it looks like <code>imul</code> is the only one that can possibly have an immediate after a RIP-relative addressing mode. That means that prior instructions using the new assembler should not be affected.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
