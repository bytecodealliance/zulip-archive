A few weeks ago I had the crazy idea of compiling SQL prepared statements instead of running them through a traditional query planner, before finding out I'm not the first one to use this approach.</p>\n<p>Right now I _transliterate_ the query to Rust before compiling it, but maybe there is a smarter approach. My questions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can Cranelift support this use case or is it too far from its original design?</li>\n<li>Could Cranelift help me skip the _transliteration_ step?</li>\n<li>Are you aware of anyone else using this same approach with Cranelift instead of LLVM?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>More details:</strong> <br>\nLet's say I have a query in the form:</p>\n<div class=\"codehilite\" data-code-language=\"Rust\"><pre><span></span><code><span class=\"n\">SELECT</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">ot</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">customer_ID</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">ct</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">customer_name</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">SUM</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ot</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">order_total</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"k\">as</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">total_amount</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">UDF</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">heavy_function</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">ot</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">order_total</span><span class=\"p\">)</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">AS</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">processed_total</span>\n<span class=\"n\">FROM</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">orders_table</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">AS</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ot</span>\n<span class=\"n\">JOIN</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">customers_table</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">AS</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ct</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ON</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ct</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">customer_ID</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ot</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">customer_ID</span>\n<span class=\"n\">WHERE</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">ot</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">customer_ID</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">IN</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"cp\">$customers_array</span>\n<span class=\"n\">AND</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">ot</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">order_date</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">BETWEEN</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"cp\">$start_date</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">AND</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"cp\">$end_date</span>\n<span class=\"n\">GROUP</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">BY</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">ot</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">customer_ID</span><span class=\"p\">,</span>\n<span class=\"w\">    </span><span class=\"n\">ct</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">customer_name</span><span class=\"p\">;</span>\n</code></pre></div>\n<p>Right now the compilation looks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The user register the SQL query before executing it</li>\n<li>I parse the query using an SQL parser</li>\n<li>I extract the parameters, these will enter in the signature of the Rust function representing the query</li>\n<li>I _transliterate_ to Rust using some very ugly code (a bunch of <code>match</code>, <code>if</code> and generic types)</li>\n<li>I run some compile time optimizations (using a cost based function, like the vulcano query planner)</li>\n<li>I compile the code</li>\n<li>I cache the compiled output</li>\n<li>I notify the user that the query is ready to use</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To run the query:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The user calls the query and provide the inputs</li>\n<li>I search for the cached compiled output using an hash of the query</li>\n<li>I launch one thread for each shard</li>\n<li>I reduce the results and present it to the user</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ideally I would like to run the query inside a WASM runtime.</p>\n<p>I apologize in advance if this question is off topic for this repo and for my noobishness. </p>\n</blockquote>",

(We have SIMD operators you'd likely want to use for scans as well.)</p>\n<p>That said, one point of clarification: you ask about <em>Cranelift</em> (which is an SSA IR to machine code compiler) but then say</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Ideally I would like to run the query inside a WASM runtime.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>which is a different thing -- to run Wasm (in our universe) one would typically use Wasmtime, which translates Wasm bytecode to Cranelift's IR then invokes Cranelift to compile that to machine code; and the resulting machine code calls into Wasmtime's runtime, so it's not a separable piece.</p>\n<p>Either generating machine code and invoking it directly (raw Cranelift JIT backend) or generating Wasm modules on the fly and loading/invoking them in Wasmtime are possible; the latter harder mainly because of the memory access question (does the Wasm module get the whole database in memory as its heap? compile-time builtins? something else?). Using just Cranelift and generating loads (and stores) to your native data structures would be the conventional and recommended approach.</p>\n<p>One other point: you ask if you could \"skip the transliteration step\", and I don't think you can no matter what you do, though you may be transliterating (\"compiling\"!) to a different target. Right now you're basically compiling SQL to Rust; instead you could compile SQL to Cranelift IR (CLIF). It's lower-level, so you'll have to implement e.g. match semantics yourself with raw if-else branches or branch tables, but very possible.</p>\n</blockquote>",

A few thoughts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>One thing to make clear is that the Wasm-based path and the CLIF-based path are more or less disjoint. Wasmtime doesn't accept CLIF; it only accepts Wasm. (Think of CLIF and the Cranelift backend as an internal implementation detail of Wasmtime; in fact it has another compiler backend that doesn't use CLIF/Cranelift at all, which can be chosen at runtime.)</li>\n<li>Given that, if we scope the problem to <em>only</em> compiling SQL, it seems pretty clear to me that compiling directly to CLIF is the most straightforward route. In essence you are implementing your own sandbox by providing only safe capabilities/abstractions at the SQL semantic level. The tradeoff is that your SQL-to-CLIF compiler is part of the trusted base and bugs in that compiler might result in sandbox escapes at the database level. But it avoids the (IMHO fairly major) impedance mismatches inherent in trying to ship data into and back out of the Wasm sandbox in a performant way when doing large scans of in-memory cached data.</li>\n<li>The UDF problem is separate and fairly interesting. In fact I've heard of others using Wasm for exactly this use-case. In theory you could do a native SQL-to-CLIF compiler that, for apply-UDF nodes in your AST, compiles to a call back into host code that then invokes the UDF Wasm module via Wasmtime APIs.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>",
