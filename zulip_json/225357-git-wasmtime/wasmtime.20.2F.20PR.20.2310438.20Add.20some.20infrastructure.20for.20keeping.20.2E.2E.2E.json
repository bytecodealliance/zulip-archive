The goal here is to add some automation and infrastructure to perform a weekly build of all active release branches which will file an issue on failure. This should ideally keep branches up-to-date and ensure that we don't forget to backport any fixes to older branches. Or rather when we do forget to backport fixes this'll be a reminder to go do that anyway.</p>\n<p>The general architecture here is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A new <code>ci-cron-trigger.yml</code> workflow is added.</li>\n<li>This new workflow runs once-a-week and runs a small script that triggers CI for all active release branches.</li>\n<li>The main CI, <code>main.yml</code>, is updated to file an issue on failure when triggered in this fashion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While I was here I additionally removed the <code>schedule:</code> from the <code>main.yml</code> to instead fold the daily scheduling of CI runs into this new script as well. That way all our cron CI jobs are gated in workflows that require this exact repository meaning that forks won't be running cron jobs.</p>\n<p>[rfc]: <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/42\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/rfcs/pull/42</a></p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

I'll manually trigger this CI run when this merges to ensure everything's working though. My hope is that 24.0.0 is probably broken at this time and we'll need to fix something so we should see an issue pop up.</p>\n</blockquote>",

If an LTS branch has been created, but not released, then we need to still look back 2 releases. The risk of that causing issues is pretty small though as that's a 2-week window and I otherwise don't know how to easily test for whether the latest branch has been released or not as part of this script.</p>\n</blockquote>",
