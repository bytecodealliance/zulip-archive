There are only two users of 64-bit atomics right now which are epochs and allocation of <code>StoreId</code>. This commit adds <code>#[cfg]</code> to epoch-related infrastructure in the runtime to turn that all of if 64-bit atomics aren't available. The thinking is that epochs more-or-less don't work without 64-bit atomics so it's easier to just remove them entirely.</p>\n<p>Allocation of <code>StoreId</code> is trickier though because it's so core to Wasmtime and it basically can't be removed. I've opted to change the allocator to 32-bit indices instead of 64-bit indices. Note that <code>StoreId</code> requires unique IDs to be allocated for safety which means that while a 64-bit integer won't overflow for a few thousand years a 32-bit integer will overflow in a few hours from quickly creating stores. The rough hope though is that embeddings on platforms like this aren't churning through stores. Regardless if this condition is triggered it'll result in a panic rather than unsoundness, so we hopefully have at least that going for us.</p>\n<p>Closes #8768</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Instead it's more of \"maybe others can do interesting things with this\". The bit about <code>StoreId</code> I'm not particularly happy with because it's something where your tiny embedded device will crash after days online and you'll have no way to easily reproduce unless you can easily debug it. That seems like a pretty bad silent failure mode but at the same time I'm not sure what else to do...</p>\n<p>Mostly saying that I'm not 100% sold this is a good idea, but I also don't know of a different way to run without 64-bit atomics right now.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The only thing we're trying to prevent is UB, which two <code>AtomicU32</code> values work just fine for.</p>\n</blockquote>",

Personally I'd prefer to avoid spin locks or panic-on-contention for something so core as creating a new store. The failure mode here specifically is creating many <code>Store&lt;T&gt;</code> instances and destroying them, where eventually that'll panic. I'm not sure if low-end devices that don't have 64-bit atomics will be doing since since I'd otherwise suspect that they'd probably create a small handful of stores (if more than 1) and use those for their lifetime.</p>\n<p>Overall I don't know what the best tradeoff is. As-is <code>Store&lt;T&gt;::new</code> will panic if called rapidly. With a spin-lock you run the risk of long pauses if you get preempted while the lock is held. With panic-on-contention you risk periodic panics if there are multiple threads/actors in the system. None seem like a great option :(</p>\n</blockquote>",

In other words, we walk through 2^64 possible tuples. They're not <em>contiguous</em> in ordinary numeric order but we don't need that -- only uniqueness.</p>\n<p>The slight wrinkle is that if we do the atomic increments separately, the two halves of the tuple sequence can \"slide\" relative to each other -- and this reduces the periodicity / can lead to repeats. I think one can fix that by incrementing the first, the second, then the first again, and using the 3-tuple. My intuition is that that bounds the \"slide\" / recovers uniqueness, but I'm having some trouble thinking through it at the moment. Maybe it inspires someone else though?</p>\n</blockquote>",

From a speed perspective I'm not too worried about that being significantly slower than the current allocation (I'd expect <code>Store&lt;T&gt;</code> allocation in general to dwarf the atomic ops). What I would be worried about though is that if something as complex as that is not on-by-default then we won't catch any possible issues with it</p>\n</blockquote>",

Our <code>no_std</code> locks currently all panic on contention under the assumption that you probably only have on thread in no_std contexts. In any case this is no worse than what Wasmtime had before this change and it's arguably more correct with respect to <code>StoreId</code>. This means that we'll still preserve 64-bit uniqueness guarantees and it'll just be a bit slower without 64-bit atomics.</p>\n<p>If the panic-on-contention bit becomes a problem then it's already one we have to solve anyway, so this way if that's a problem we still only have one problem to solve as opposed to two.</p>\n</blockquote>",
