That PR itself isn't the fault per-se but rather uncovered a preexisting issue on riscv64. According to riscv64's ABI docs it looks like arguments are all expected to be sign-extended, whereas currently in Wasmtime all host signatures are zero-extended on all platforms. This commit applies two changes to fix this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A new <code>TargetIsa::default_argument_extension</code> method was added which is now used instead of unconditionally using <code>uext</code> to apply to all arguments/results.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>While I was here I went ahead and split apart things where the wasm signature of a builtin doesn't use <code>uext</code> or <code>sext</code>. The host signature still does, however, which means that any extension necessary happens in the trampoline we generate per-libcall as opposed to at all callsites.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I'm not certain that all platforms require <code>uext</code> but I've left the <code>TargetIsa</code> implementation as <code>uext</code> for now with a comment explaining why. Currently the only non-<code>uext</code> platforms are riscv64, which is <code>sext</code> to fix the issue from #10040, and Pulley which is \"none\" as things work differently there.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
