I've also updated this to include WASIp1 APIs to discourage differential fuzzing of WASIp1 as the proposal is effectively not suitable for this. I've noted, though, that WASIp2-and-beyond should be suitable for differential fuzzing.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
