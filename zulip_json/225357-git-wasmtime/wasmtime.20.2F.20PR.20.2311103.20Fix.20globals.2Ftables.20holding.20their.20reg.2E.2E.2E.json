This could lead to runtime panics when reflecting on their type and additionally lead to some type confusion about the global/table itself. As described in #11102 this is not a security issue, just a bug that needs fixing.</p>\n<p>Closes #11102</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
