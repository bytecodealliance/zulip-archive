Locally setting <code>RUST_LOG</code> and running <code>cargo run test filetests</code> showed a panic in the s390x backend that this test was not uncovering. The reason that this test wasn't actually doing anything on CI is that it's tested adjacently with the <code>wasmtime-cli</code> crate. Both crates are tested with <code>--all-features</code> which enables the CLI's <code>disable-logging</code> feature which meant that all logging statements, including the ones we want to test, were compiled out.</p>\n<p>This commit fixes the s390x panic and then additionally adds a special CI job (repurposing an existing one) for testing just this test in isolation.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
