This fixes a regression found in the wasip3-prototyping repository where new component intrinsics didn't have this set and subsequently were failing in riscv64 CI.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
