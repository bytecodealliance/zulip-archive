There is only one occurrence where we need these in this PR and the hoping is that by the time next PR lands, we'll have them available in the runtime.~</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>add tests, ~but ignore them, since async machinery still panics.~ the tests are adapted from analogous p2 tests</li>\n<li>allow specifying a subdirectory in WIT fetch script, since p3 WIT lives in a draft subdirectory</li>\n<li>extract a common <code>WasiCtxBuilder</code> to use for both p2 and p3. Unfortunately, inheritance is sort of tricky here - I originally hoped to implement <code>Deref</code> on the p2/p3 builders, but that breaks the chaining that users are used to, e.g. <code>builder.inherit_env().build()</code> would not work, since <code>inherit_env</code> would return a reference to the inner builder, rather than the outer one. Just duplicate the methods for p2 and p3 for now - let's revisit once we have all of the interfaces implemented and more context on how we can handle this. A macro is potential solution. The reason these contexts are different types is primarily stdio - the abstractions are very different for wasip2 and wasip3.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>closes #10061 <br>\ncloses #10063 </p>\n<p>refs <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasip3-prototyping/issues/228\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasip3-prototyping/issues/228</a></p>\n</blockquote>",
