In the process, I realized the future API ought to be updated to support blocking cancellation just like the stream API, so I made that change as well.</p>\n<p>This also adds <code>{Source,Destination}::reborrow</code> functions, allowing instances of those types to be reborrowed, such that they may be passed as parameters but also used again.</p>\n<p>Note that I had to move some functions from <code>impl ConcurrentState</code> to <code>impl Instance</code> in order to access the store and suspend the current fiber when synchronously cancelling.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

I don't know of a great answer to this, nor is this PR the place to necessarily work this all out, but I feel like we need to change something about this either API-wise or such.</p>\n</blockquote>",
