It's mostly written by me and I don't know C++. I also think it's worthwhile to call out that Rust/C are explicitly tier 1 and we support CVEs with them, for example.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
