Notably these changes were made:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Sink icache maintenance into <code>vm::sys</code> modules. This is fallout of #11152 where no_std support was added for unix/windows targets. This commit moves the error-on-lack-of-std to the <code>unix</code> and <code>windows</code> modules, relegating the custom module to figure its own pieces out as necessary. This also feels like a more accurate reflection of how responsibilities should be sliced up.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The example runner now uses <code>bail!</code> to return an error in case something bad happens instead of continuing as usual and pretending nothing bad happened.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",
