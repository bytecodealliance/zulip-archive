That is, this method (and any others we might eventually add like it) would no longer need to be <code>unsafe</code> as long as it yielded <code>DefinedInstance</code>s instead of <code>Instance</code>s:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/eb54a90ece02e4ac5a26e81809944496f6e65604/crates/wasmtime/src/runtime/store.rs#L1308-L1332\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/eb54a90ece02e4ac5a26e81809944496f6e65604/crates/wasmtime/src/runtime/store.rs#L1308-L1332</a></p>\n<p>To cut down on code duplication, we would probably want an <code>Instance</code> to deref to a <code>DefinedInstance</code> or something like that. Probably <code>Instance</code> would be a newtype of <code>DefinedInstance</code> that has methods for accessing imported items and anything that accesses that stuff, and then it also derefs to its inner <code>DefinedInstance</code>.</p>\n<p>cc @alexcrichton </p>\n</blockquote>",
