This avoids potential repeated work and is easier to ensure that it is complete and covers all values associated with a variable, since by the time we are finalizing the function, we won't add any new values for a variable that we will need to keep track of and propagate this information to.</p>\n<p>This also means that we can remove the <code>params_added_to_blocks</code> vector from the SSA side effects structure, since it was only used to online-update the <code>stack_map_values</code> set.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed.

I'm unsure which part of the code you are referring to with this comment.</p>\n<p>And while that finalization loop is <code>O(vars * vals)</code> in the worse case where every variable is marked as needing a stack map and every value is associated with not just one but every single variable, I wouldn't really call that quadratic because <code>vars</code> and <code>vals</code> are two independent big-O variables. Similarly, I wouldn't really call an <code>O(edges * vertices)</code> graph algorithm quadratic.</p>\n<p>Either way, I don't think it actually matters in this case. It shouldn't be possible to write a Wasm program that constructs that worst case input or anything like it. And it would be pretty difficult to accidentally generate this code with any typical <code>cranelift_frontend</code> usage (even in the face of translating untrusted code to CLIF). It would require using the <code>cranelift_frontend</code> API directly in a fairly malicious way to create that worst case.</p>\n</blockquote>",
