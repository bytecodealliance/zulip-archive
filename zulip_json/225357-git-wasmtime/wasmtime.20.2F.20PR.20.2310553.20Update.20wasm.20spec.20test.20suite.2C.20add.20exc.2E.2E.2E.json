The latest commit will require updating the <code>wast</code> dependency which isn't published yet.</p>\n<p>This update brings in the <code>wasm-3.0</code> folder of tests since it's been awhile since the last update. That update notably means that the exception-handling proposal is mixed in with all the others with various tests. Getting tests as flagged as passing or failing as a result was unexpectedly difficult.</p>\n<p>The solution I ended up settling on was to preemptively implement some infrastructure for the exceptions proposal:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>wasmtime::Config</code> methods</li>\n<li><code>wasmtime</code> CLI flags</li>\n<li>integration with wast testing</li>\n<li>various updates to <code>should_fail</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It turns out we can run a few tests with the exception proposal, notably due to tags being implemented for stack switching. That meant that this couldn't blanket ignore the exceptions proposal and say it's expected to fail. Instead the proposal is said \"this passes!\" and tests are individually listed as \"this is expected to fail\".</p>\n<p>This then required changing an <code>unsupported!</code> panic to plumbing errors around to avoid actually implementing the exceptions proposal here.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation. If it was discussed in an issue, just mention \"issue #...\".</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Explain why this change is needed. If the details are in an issue already,<br>\n  this can be brief.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our development process is documented in the Wasmtime book:<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html\">https://docs.wasmtime.dev/contributing-development-process.html</a></p>\n<p>Please ensure all communication follows the code of conduct:<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md\">https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</a><br>\n--&gt;</p>\n</blockquote>",

This is required to have the current wast-testing to more easily plumb this around, but we can fix that if necessary. Additionally I was thinking that with an implementation of the exceptions proposal it's probably not actually hard at all to add support for this (forever off-by-default of course).</p>\n<p>My hope though is that this stays as-is and goes no further, and if/when the legacy tests are ever purged from the spec test suite we can remove this.</p>\n</blockquote>",
