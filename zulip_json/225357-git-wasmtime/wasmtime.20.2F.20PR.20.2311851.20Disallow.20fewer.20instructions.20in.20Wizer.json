These are fine to execute and the incompatibility with Wizer instead comes when a table or a reference type global is mutated. That mutation is disallowed elsewhere, however, so there's no need to reject these instructions.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
