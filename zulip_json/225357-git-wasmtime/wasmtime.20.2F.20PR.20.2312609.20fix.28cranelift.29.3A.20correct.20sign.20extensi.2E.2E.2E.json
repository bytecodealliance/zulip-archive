The code was pushing the <code>ireduce</code> result to the value stack and then immediately popping a different value (the next value on the stack) for the <code>sextend</code> operation.<br>\nChanges: Store the <code>ireduce</code> result in a local variable and use it directly in <code>sextend</code> instead of popping from the stack.</p>\n</blockquote>",

The intermediate push-then-pop has the effect of carrying through the result of the reduce to the sign-extend. Nothing is discarded, and the \"next value on the stack\" is not used.</p>\n<p>I didn't write this code so I don't know the intent for sure but I can imagine this is meant to express the operator as a composition of the two operations. It's a little odd, but it's not incorrect.</p>\n<p>Your description (\"fix\") implies that you observed an incorrect execution. Did you, and if so can you show the test case here? And can you explain your reasoning a bit more?</p>\n</blockquote>",
