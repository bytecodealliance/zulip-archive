This is a necessary step towards fully using the new assembler for ALU instructions (<code>AluRmiR</code> is only used for zeroing registers now).</p>\n<p>A couple items of note:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there are a few places where <code>lower.isle</code> wants to abstract over some subset of ALU operations to avoid repetition; this change retains that via some <code>x64_*_flags</code> helpers that take a new type (<code>ChainFlagsOp</code>, e.g.) that restricts which operations the helper can use. This is not a major refactor but it does show that we use these flag-producing instructions in quite limited ways.</li>\n<li>we previously decided to keep rules that used wider versions of registers for i8/i16 operations to avoid CPU dependencies; this is problematic for instructions that rely on overflow, though, so this change extracts those \"wider register\" rules into <code>x64_*_break_deps</code> helpers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
