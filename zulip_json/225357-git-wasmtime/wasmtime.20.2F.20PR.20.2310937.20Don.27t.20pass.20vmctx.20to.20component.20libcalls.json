There's still much <code>unsafe</code> in the libcalls due to their arguments or accessing <code>*instance.store()</code>, but this latter part will be fixed in a follow-up commit soon.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
