Shared code is defined in <code>machinst::abi</code> used by all backends to perform the requisite loads.</p>\n<p>In order to make this work with more defined values than fit in registers, however, this PR also had to add support for \"any\"-constrained registers to Cranelift, and handling allocations that may be spillslots. This has always been supported by RA2, but this is the first time that Cranelift uses them directly (previously they were used only internally in RA2 as lowerings from other kinds of constraints like safepoints). This requires encoding a spillslot index in our <code>Reg</code> type.</p>\n<p>There is a little bit of complexity around handling the loads/defs as well: if we have a return value on-stack, and we need to put it in a spillslot, we cannot do a memory-to-memory move directly, so we need a temporary register. Earlier versions of this PR allocated another temp as a vreg on the call, but this doesn't work with all calling conventions (too many clobbers). For simplicity I picked a particular register that is (i) clobbered by calls and (ii) not used for return values for each architecture (x86-64's tailcall needed to lose one return-in-register slot to make this work).</p>\n<p>This removes retval insts from the shared ABI infra completely. s390x is different, still, because it handles callsite lowering from ISLE; we will need to address that separately for exception support there.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.

Not only is this further complicating the <code>is_included_in_clobbers</code> mechanism, it also introduces performance regressions.</p>\n<p>The original reason for <code>is_included_in_clobbers</code> was that for partially callee-saved registers (e.g. on s390x, only the top half of some vector registers, which overlap the old floating-point registers, is callee-saved), in a sequence of A calling B calling C, we have to conservatively assume that the call B-&gt;C clobbers them, while the call A-&gt;B must preserve them, and therefore B will have to save/restore them all.  Of course, as long as the A-&gt;B calling convention is the same as the B-&gt;C calling convention, we can avoid this, which is implemented via <code>is_included_in_clobbers</code>.</p>\n<p>Now, assuming the call B-&gt;C needs another def as it has to load a return value into a callee-saved register.  We have to consider this, which is what the new <code>has_non_abi_defs</code> mechanism achieves.  However, that will then also have the side effect of once again forcing B to save/restore all floating-point registers - there's really no good reason for this.</p>\n<p>Quite a while ago, I made the suggestion that <code>is_included_in_clobbers</code> should really only apply to the <em>clobber</em> list, not the <em>def</em> list.  If we were to make that change, then the extra defs for this case would just happen to work transparently without any new <code>has_non_abi_defs</code> mechanism, and it would not introduce the above regression.<br>\n</p>\n</blockquote>",
