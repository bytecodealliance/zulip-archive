Now we do it for both, and test the scenario where a proxy component forwards a inbound request body to an outbound request and then exits before that body has finished streaming, in which case the stream should continue flowing (assuming the embedder _wants_ it to).</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
