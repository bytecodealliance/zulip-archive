Because mutating the serialized bytes can also result in invalid and out-of-bounds <code>TableOps</code> instances. This just does the fixup in the one place, instead of needing to remember all the different places where we might need to do it.</p>\n<p>cc @khagankhan </p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
