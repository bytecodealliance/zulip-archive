Specifically when an enum or variant had exactly 256 cases the comparison of the discriminant for being out-of-bounds was done in the n-bit space of the discriminant rather than a bit-space that can hold the entire discriminant. The fix here is to compare with a <code>u32</code> instead of a <code>u8</code> to ensure that if there are 256 variants it actually compares against 256 instead of 0 by accident.</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
