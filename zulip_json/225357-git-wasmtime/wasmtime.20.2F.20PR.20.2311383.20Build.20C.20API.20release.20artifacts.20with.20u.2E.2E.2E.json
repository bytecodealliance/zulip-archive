This was due to the fact that Wasmtime's C API artifacts do not have unwind information built-in due to being build with <code>-Cpanic=abort</code>. This change updates to building the C API artifacts with <code>-Cforce-unwind-tables</code> even though Rust itself won't use them to assist with embedders that want to unwind. These should in theory be easily strippable if desired and additionally embedders always have the option to build their own version of the C API too.</p>\n<p>Closes #11344</p>\n<p>&lt;!--<br>\nPlease make sure you include the following information:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>If this work has been discussed elsewhere, please include a link to that<br>\n  conversation.
