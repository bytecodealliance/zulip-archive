Is this <a href=\"http://wasi.dev\">wasi.dev</a>? -- if so, it doesn't look like a registry, but rather a docs page?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If there's no central public registry, then the applications would have to manage auth and publishing rights. In this case, I'm curious if someone has opinions or thoughts on this: if you were creating an application where users can publish packages to a warg registry, how would you structure package names &amp; namespaces?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For example it could be in the format <code>{username}:{package-name}</code> so that users have full control over both the namespace (as it is their username that they pick when signing up to the app) and the package name. The problem with this is that if someone has the username that already is used from a 'default' registry then it can cause conflicts, for example if someone registers the username of 'wasi' or 'wasm'.</p>\n<p>It could also be formatted as <code>app-name-{username}:{package-name}</code> to workaround that previous issue.</p>\n<p>It alternatively be formatted as <code>app-name:user-name-{package-name}</code>. Or also just <code>app-name:{package-name}</code> but then there's no namespacing between users.</p>\n<p>Just wondering if there are any suggestions or best practices with this.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"http://crates.io\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/75f8c66509c680a2345cca9b6adaf7e2cdb6f41b/68747470733a2f2f6372617465732e696f2f6173736574732f6f672d696d6167652e706e67&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"http://crates.io\" title=\"crates.io: Rust Package Registry\">crates.io: Rust Package Registry</a></div></div></div>",
