What the researchers highlight (vendor-specific HCI commands to read &amp; write controller memory) is a common design pattern found in other Bluetooth chips from other vendors as well, such as Broadcom, Cypress, and Texas Instruments. Vendor-specific commands in Bluetooth effectively constitute a \"private API\", and a company's choice to not publicly document their private API does not constitute a \"backdoor\".</div></div></div>",
