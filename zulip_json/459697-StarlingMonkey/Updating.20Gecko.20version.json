The version of PBL here passes all JIT-tests still in interpreter mode. Unfortunately when wevaling, I'm running into some really odd code-patterns that modern LLVM is generating in the Wasm -- in particular, it seems to be tail-merging specialized and non-specialized paths in a way that breaks weval's context tracking and causes processing errors. I'm trying to work out a way to either guide the compiler with intrinsics (possibly workable, but brittle) or build stronger optimizations/preprocessing steps into weval to make this work.</p>\n<p>(In a little more detail: there is an extremely maddening code sequence that LLVM is generating where, on checking for error after an IC return, we're supposed to be in shared tail-call-into-interpreter slowpath code; but it's merging this path with the happy path, then doing another redundant check of the error code and then branching to the slowpath. I suspect this may be some weird relooper thing to avoid irreducible control flow, somehow reusing some path-dependent value for the condition/flag.

        "content": "<p>OK, I'm going to give a somewhat unfortunate update here: I don't think updating the Gecko version that we support with AOT compilation is going to be feasible without substantial additional engineering.</p>\n<p>The problem I've been banging into now is that LLVM seems to be doing some much more clever relooper-pass transforms (Wasm structured control flow reconstruction) where it re-uses branch conditions in ways that merge together different control flow paths statically, but reuse existing branch conditions to separate them dynamically. So when we have the weval traversal visit a particular opcode case that has an early out (e.g. an IC guard failure), we see something like: <code>if (x != k) goto bail; fallthrough...</code> but the <code>goto bail</code> path goes <em>through</em> a common exit block with <code>fallthrough</code>, and the <code>x != k</code> test is repeated further down to actually bail.</p>\n<p>To maintain context specialization that allows weval to statically lay out the compiled code, it needs to reason about the two paths through that common exit block separately. But even if I use a nested context to try to do that, when we visit the common block in the exit context, we see a <em>statically possible</em> edge back to the top of the interpreter loop. This edge is never actually taken, because we're already in the <code>x != k</code> case and the edge is guarded with <code>x == k</code>. But weval doesn't have SCCP or equivalent that can track path-specific constant facts.</p>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/weval/tree/cfallin/value-specialization\">this branch</a> I've been building out some infrastructure that tries to do that, but the problem is that we don't directly pass a value through the branch-args that can be value-specialized; we see a branch on <code>x != k</code> and then we have to scan all other values in-scope and reason about them and potentially update their abstract analysis state. That's an ugly and non-scalable O(n^2) analysis problem.</p>\n<p>So the tl;dr here is: LLVM got smarter in its generated Wasm; weval needs too much (non-scalable, non-feasible, non-tractable?) analysis to see through it; it's both unclear whether this is possible at all, and the exploration to know for sure is too much of a deep-dive for me to reasonably spend time on it. (A real fix here would need months of full-time probably, which is not something I have.)</p>\n<p>Anyway, my recommendation is that if the SpiderMonkey update is more important, let's drop AOT; or if losing the 3-5x speedup would be too painful, then we're stuck on v127 and an older wasi-sdk for a while more.
