        "content": "<p>hey all, im looking to use WAMR for some portable dynamic plugins for my robotics controller (cortex m mainly). the goal was to allow 'micro modules', tiny little modules that have just a few functions (or even just 1) and very little if any persistent state. in this case the absolute minimum memory consumption is necessary, SHRUNK_MEMORY is nice but is 1. nonstandard and 2. some high level languages will use memory.grow anyway and we dont have much control. </p>\n<p>the proposal has progressed quite a bit since the last few issues/questions i've seen, lots of toolchain support. is there anywhere tracking the progress on implementation for WAMR? if no one is working on it im happy to take a stab at it</p>",
