We generally only use secure components, and prefer that they are audited by third parties, given the magnitude of issues if there was a vulnerability.</p>\n<p>Do you have any such recent-ish audit that we can look at? Is there someone I can contact about this?</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/e92eb1da88b42e7849d743d89c1852a6335067b1/68747470733a2f2f7265706f7369746f72792d696d616765732e67697468756275736572636f6e74656e742e636f6d2f323732343136372f63653232623730302d353130352d313165622d396133632d343136346533626166326130&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/XRPLF/rippled/\" title=\"GitHub - XRPLF/rippled: Decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain daemon implementing the XRP Ledger protocol in C++\">GitHub - XRPLF/rippled: Decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain daemon implementing the XRP Ledger protocol in C++</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Decentralized cryptocurrency blockchain daemon implementing the XRP Ledger protocol in C++ - XRPLF/rippled</div></div></div>",
