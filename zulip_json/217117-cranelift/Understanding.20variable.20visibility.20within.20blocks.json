As demonstrated here, and elsewhere, they often/usually hallucinate completely incorrect details and mislead, creating more work for us in the long run. Compiler work as a field requires careful precision and is profoundly unsuited for any assistance from any sort of AI that exists at the moment. Please assume the tools will make up incorrect information and grossly mislead you (because they will -- their entire purpose is to produce text that \"sounds right\" with no further grounding) and avoid them entirely when working with Cranelift.</p>",
