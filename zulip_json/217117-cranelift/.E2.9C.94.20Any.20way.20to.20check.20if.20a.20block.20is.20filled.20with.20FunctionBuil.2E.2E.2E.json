I'm using <a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-frontend/0.92.0/cranelift_frontend/struct.FunctionBuilder.html\">FunctionBuilder</a> to translate my own basic blocks to cranelift IR. Is there an easy way to check if a cranelift Block has a terminator/is filled? Or do I need to keep track of whether I have added a terminator instruction myself? Thanks!</p>",

You can use <code>builder.func.layout.last_inst(block)</code> to get the last instruction of a block (which will return <code>None</code> if the block is empty). Then <code>builder.func.dfg.insts[inst].is_terminator()</code> should tell you whether that instruction is valid for ending the block. But you might find it easier to keep track of this yourself.</p>",

In case anyone else is here for similar reasons: I think its better to create an extra block and trust cranelift to simply throw away that block since its obviously unreachable. This way you don't need a bunch of guards all over the place checking if a block is filled in case you slip some stray jump instructions into that block.</p>",
