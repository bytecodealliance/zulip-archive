        "content": "<p>TL;DR, I want to create a new instruction set for a custom simulated CPU I made. What are the places I need to insert new code, what pitfalls might I need to be aware of, and what resources are available for help?</p>\n<p>As a bit of background, I'm an electrical engineer with a long background of programming, especially Rust as of late. Back in college I made a CPU with a custom instruction set as part of a class, that I then expanded to be \"complete\". I made a simple python \"assembler\" of sorts to compile my own assembly into the required machine code, then was able to insert it into the ROM of the CPU to run it. It was overall a fun project (<a href=\"https://github.com/Trevader24135/Trevader24135/tree/main/ECEN160Computer\">here</a>, in case anyone's curious).</p>\n<p>It struck me that it's theoretically possible that I could hijack existing projects, like LLVM or Cranelift, to compile rust code for this CPU, which seems really exciting to me. LLVM has a guide for contributing a new ISA, but I'd rather not pursue that route because writing that much heavy C++ just doesn't excite me. That's when I remembered that Rust supports Cranelift as an experimental backend, and I started taking a look.</p>\n<p>I've found a couple places that are obvious candidates to add a new ISA, like <code>cranelift/codegen/src/isa</code>, where I might be able to get away with mostly copy-pasting the RISCV ISA and disecting/modifying it, but I've been unable to find any kind of guidance on doing so, which makes that seem very daunting.</p>\n<p>I'd be happy to work through this and write up a guide (maybe a blog post or something) for future contributors so that others have a starting point for creating a new ISA, but before I fully commit to the project, I wanted to get people's impressions here of the feasibility of doing this, and their thoughts on the best way to get started.</p>\n<p>This is completely a hobby project, and I work full time and am working through a master's degree, so it's not like I'll get this done overnight or any time soon, but I still think it'd be super fun. I'd appreciate any help anyone's willing to offer, and I especially appreciate your patience. Thanks.</p>\n<p>Edit: also, I'm very aware that the simulated CPU will likely need some fairly extensive improvements to work as expected as well, but that's probably going to be part of the fun</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/Trevader24135/Trevader24135/tree/main/ECEN160Computer\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/12c77d6efd8374109005c0556cfdf94b8b898660/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f346235373438323332303231316565323865386431326366636461323562663932343634623830323365633739396630366339323230623733386364333834362f547265766164657232343133352f54726576616465723234313335&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/Trevader24135/Trevader24135/tree/main/ECEN160Computer\" title=\"Trevader24135/ECEN160Computer at main · Trevader24135/Trevader24135\">Trevader24135/ECEN160Computer at main · Trevader24135/Trevader24135</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Config files for my GitHub profile.

It's been a while since I've played with verilog and that would be a great excuse. I certainly think that you're correct that if making a working CPU was my goal, that'd be the best way to do it, but mostly I think this would be a cool project.</p>\n<p>Plus, this could open the door down the line if, for example, I find myself wanting to target a microcontroller with a toolchain that's incompatible with the rust compiler and I want to add support. Obviously, in that case, it would probably make more sense to add that target to LLVM, but that sounds less fun to me!</p>\n<p>Thanks for that example CPU by the way, I may use that for reference down the road ;D</p>",
