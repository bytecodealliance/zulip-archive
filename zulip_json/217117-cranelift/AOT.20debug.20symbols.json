I was hoping that <br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.rs/cranelift-codegen/0.117.2/cranelift_codegen/ir/function/struct.FunctionStencil.html#method.collect_debug_info\">FunctionStencil.collect_debug_info</a> would help but it doesn't appear to affect my output, so I can only assume that it's intended for JIT-targetted code.<br>\nI understand that DWARF information can be inserted into the object before writing to disk, but I've had trouble finding cranelift-specific examples (other than the rustc repository which I will look into soon), and the DWARF specification itself is likewise difficult to parse in order to produce a working example for my own code.</p>\n<p>Searching for specific details has been difficult so I'm hoping someone here could help to clarify. I've tried looking into using the DWARF format but  I'm having difficulties orienting myself around the specification and how cranelift, gimli and objects interact with each other due to the sparse documentation. Maybe I'm just biting off more than I can chew.</p>\n<p>If someone could redirect me to appropriate documentation or some other solution (am I just missing something obvious?) I'd be very appreciative.</p>",

I've tried to track down the source but I haven't been able to find a stack trace from the error.</p>\n<p>Do you have any pointers as to what may be causing the error?  As I understand it, the Symbols (in gimli) should be able to work just fine with FuncIds and I haven't been able to find anything to help troubleshoot. I can run the generated code just fine.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_cranelift/tree/8364234af67e7a9211070a637d1a9791b6007e6e/src/debuginfo\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/6de7b5cd8fdc51ab4035038f30245e134ad2a6c2/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f363238386630656231313361626664383437623366366335333266373739313730656263363837383431653464373761366338396361653961643966303262662f727573742d6c616e672f72757374635f636f646567656e5f6372616e656c696674&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/rust-lang/rustc_codegen_cranelift/tree/8364234af67e7a9211070a637d1a9791b6007e6e/src/debuginfo\" title=\"rustc_codegen_cranelift/src/debuginfo at 8364234af67e7a9211070a637d1a9791b6007e6e · rust-lang/rustc_codegen_cranelift\">rustc_codegen_cranelift/src/debuginfo at 8364234af67e7a9211070a637d1a9791b6007e6e · rust-lang/rustc_codegen_cranelift</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Cranelift based backend for rustc.
