After that is seeing if WASI-SDK 21 has what's necessary for <code>dlopen()</code> and figuring out how to tell the community to get the packages to work. Then we have to decide how the wheel platform tags will function (both what they specify and how to tell if a platform supports the tag), especially with wasi-libc having no forwards/backwards-compatibility. Once that's all done we can the ask to allow for uploads to PyPI and hopefully get various build backends to support WASI.</p>",

Regarding binary sizes, I posted this elsewhere a while ago, in case it's useful:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I did some research to determine a size breakdown for a \"hello world\" wasi-http component generated by <code>componentize-py</code>.<br>\nThe TL;DR is that the stripped binary is about 18MB, 12MB of which is the data section with the pre-init memory snapshot, and the rest of which are the various modules, the largest of which is <code>libpython312.so</code> at about 4MB.<br>\nA stock, stripped <code>libpython312.so</code> is about 8MB, 4MB of which is data section(s) which get replaced with the memory snapshot when we pre-init.<br>\nThe upshot is that we could save about 6MB per component by importing the modules it needs, but we'd still be looking at 12MB minimum component sizes.  To reduce sizes further, we'd need some way to package the <code>.py</code>, <code>.pyc</code>, and related standard library files into a composable VFS component we could publish to a registry and reuse.  And we'd also need a standard way to export a pre-init function that can be run by the host (e.g. at deployment time) to minimize cold-start times since we wouldn't be doing pre-init at build time anymore.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The numbers change when you start adding in large third-party dependencies, of course.  And e.g. <code>numpy</code> brings its own <code>.so</code> modules which could be reused.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>BTW, the stripped Python component is 6MB (down from 18MB) when using <code>zstd</code></p>\n</blockquote>",

There are also probably other files that are more for compiling extensions than for running Python itself.</p>\n<p>For the stdlib, we could work to strip stuff out more aggressively unless Joel is already leaving out parts that won't work. Otherwise the stdlib is portable and just needs to be found at <code>../lib/python3.X/site-packages</code>.</p>\n<p>As for pre-init, I didn't even know that Joel was doing that and I don't know what function is being called for that. But I will say that towards the bottom of my WASI todo list was trying to refactor CPython to make it easier to pre-init depending on the situation (e.g. locked down environment, generic to any machine, etc.).</p>",
