There is an issue I created at <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/issues/2409\">https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/issues/2409</a> to canvas the runtime team's opinion.  However it is largely up to us, I was just exploring options.  In general it seems that issues should live with the code so if we carry on with Rust then we could ask for somewhere in BA, however if we move quickly to c# then a new project under dotnet/runtime would be better.  At least that is how I am seeing it currently, but happy to go with the consensus.</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/issues/2409\" style=\"background-image: url(https\\:\\/\\/uploads\\.zulipusercontent\\.net\\/e83b002be12004ad8c570fe8bbf627c793b19546\\/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f303433306264356536386634303337303762656535346365313862343530313965613663333332353061646334306464303733373834636636663763646136322f646f746e65742f72756e74696d656c61622f6973737565732f32343039)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet/runtimelab/issues/2409\" title=\"NativeAOT-LLVM: Question: Does dotnet/runtimelab want to host WIT code gen issues 路 Issue #2409 路 dotnet/runtimelab\">NativeAOT-LLVM: Question: Does dotnet/runtimelab want to host WIT code gen issues 路 Issue #2409 路 dotnet/runtimelab</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">Hi, I started a discussion on https://bytecodealliance.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/394175-SIG-Guest-Languages about where to host a place where the interested parties can discuss the way forward f...</div></div></div>",
