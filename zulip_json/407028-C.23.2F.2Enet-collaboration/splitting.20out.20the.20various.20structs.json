I realize its a big change but I think it might help others coming to the code.  I know even after working on the project for awhile, didn't really understand how all the different parts interacted.   I hope this helps make it a bit more digestitable for others.  <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"395878\">@Scott Waye</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"509936\">@Joel Dice</span> <span class=\"user-mention\" data-user-id=\"556206\">@Timmy Silesmo</span></p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen/pull/1110\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/c2cda039390fb3add3570cee02923af2e861f2a3/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f346563366635383231306533346164646661643964306331306537616336663838636436626132323432633437653334313131653538323863376335356634622f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f7769742d62696e6467656e2f70756c6c2f31313130&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen/pull/1110\" title=\"c#: Mechanical refactors by jsturtevant 路 Pull Request #1110 路 bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen\">c#: Mechanical refactors by jsturtevant 路 Pull Request #1110 路 bytecodealliance/wit-bindgen</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">There are a lot of changes here but no functional changes.
