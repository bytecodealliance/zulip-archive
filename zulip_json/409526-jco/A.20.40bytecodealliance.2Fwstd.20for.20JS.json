And what makes <code>hono</code> work (it's been built wonderfully) is it's closeness to standards and <em>built in flexibility</em> -- the reason it was able to be adapted so well is because of how Hono was built, and unfortunately other older frameworksa ren't quite that way.</p>\n<p>I'm interested in meeting developers where they are <em>today</em>, and making a good experience for them and I think a facade for Express would do that -- hopefully I'm not mistaken here.</p>\n<p>Also, just a side note, it's absolutely intended that we have the <code>hono</code> implementation (and others!) available as part of this new SDK!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What I'd really like in something like std is a filesystem api readily available.

To give a completely different example, we moved Cranelift into the Wasmtime repository years ago because we realized that we'd either have to do that, or over time would end up writing a second embedding replicating much of Wasmtime, simply because to fully and properly test Cranelift we'd need a pretty comprehensive testing embedding.
