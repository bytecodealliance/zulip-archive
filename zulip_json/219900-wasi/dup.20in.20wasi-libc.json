As for wasip2, there is no api for it either, but given that there is no direct correspondence between resource numbers and fd's anymore, I guess it would be possible for wasi-libc to emulate multiple fd's pointing to the same fd once wasi-libc natively implements wasip2 (currently it is implemented using an adapter from wasip1 to wasip2)</p>",
