Is it possible for the host to provide this logging Interface for all these interfaces, or should each component you plug in to reexport the logging interface it imported from it's predecessor.<br>\nAs an alternative I think you could also export multiple identical interfaces on the host, one for each component that needs it.</p>\n<p>Any thoughts?</p>\n<p>It is related to the <a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component/issues/404\">issue/info request</a> I just created for the documentation. <code>Cargo component</code> will automatically import the necessary WASI interfaces it requires, but can you also easily re-export some of those interfaces?  It's not that you mentioned them in your own WIT. And I also assume you will need to do some plumbing to get the export connected to the import.<br>\nSo in short, main component needs WASI interfaces, not an issue, the runtime will provide the interfaces, but if a depending component also needs to use WASI interfaces, what do you need to do then.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance for some feedback.<br>\nJan</p>\n<div class=\"message_embed\"><a class=\"message_embed_image\" href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component/issues/404\" style=\"background-image: url(&quot;https://uploads.zulipusercontent.net/7753bb6912fd3186ea3df8cacc4572c9c27bcdf1/68747470733a2f2f6f70656e67726170682e6769746875626173736574732e636f6d2f336363646434306364326662656165383561333134663337373461306631653664646634623433376232396132316137633437616665666664393231386630372f62797465636f6465616c6c69616e63652f636172676f2d636f6d706f6e656e742f6973737565732f343034&quot;)\"></a><div class=\"data-container\"><div class=\"message_embed_title\"><a href=\"https://github.com/bytecodealliance/cargo-component/issues/404\" title=\"Cargo Component WASI Interfaces 路 Issue #404 路 bytecodealliance/cargo-component\">Cargo Component WASI Interfaces 路 Issue #404 路 bytecodealliance/cargo-component</a></div><div class=\"message_embed_description\">The Documentation mentions that By default, cargo-component imports any required WASI interfaces for us without needing to explicitly declare them.
