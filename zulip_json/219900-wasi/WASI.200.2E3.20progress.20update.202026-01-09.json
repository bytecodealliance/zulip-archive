Of the remaining 5 cases he had a good sense of how to solve 3, and we spent some time going through the remaining 2 synchronously in the call.</p>\n<p>Those 223 tests are the Wasmtime tests. Once those pass the next steps are to bring over the <code>wasi-testsuite</code> and <code>component-model</code> tests. (Note: I forget whether that should also include the Wasmtime WASI tests, but I believe so). But especially for the WASI tests it should be much easier to have multiple people working on that.</p>\n<p>Long story short: good progress is being made, but we’re not quite there yet. Once we start burning down WASI tests, it’ll be easier to estimate how long the remaining work will take.</p>",
